0, Parental Content Review
1, Director Wayne Wang proves with Maid in Manhattan that even predictable movies can leave you feeling warm and fuzzy.
0, the lack of dramatic development doesn't leave much for the actors to work with
1, A riveting documentary that explains education and the violent changes that are rocking Pakistan.
0," The problem with The Informant!, aside from that overcoaxing exclamation mark, is that it's not especially funny."
0, Too tepid and too predictable of a picture to simply sail away into the sunset.
0, Bernie lacks the edge of malice one might reasonably expect from so nasty a tale.
0, Simply one of the poorest entertainments ever offered up to the world's children.
0," More drab ""fi"" than dreamy ""sci."""
1," With its emphasis on nature and its mudbound farmers, this beautifully crafted film recalls other earthly European historical dramas set in an isolated countryside."
1," It's not like having a real film of Nijinsky, but at least it's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered."
1,"The intelligently observed and staggeringly beautiful Italian foreign-language Oscar nominee is about life, death and the search for the things that give meaning to both."
0, Yields at least two spectacular scenes... The rest is a little more uneven. 
0," The 'Mr. Holland's Opus' meets 'Rocky II' story will satisfy some who long for innocuous content, even those who know James deserves better material."
0," The Lawnmower Man, Max Headroom and Johnny Depp walk into a bar. They get drunk and decide to make a movie."
1, The Cell's striking visuals along with its fantastical costumes absolutely mesmerize the viewers.
0, Director Takashi Miike's dish of sukiyaki spaghetti ala Sergio Corbucci is badly seasoned with scraps of reservoir dogs.
1, [House of Wax] gleefully trots out all the clich√©s of the genre before going out in a blaze of glory with a truly spectacular final act.
1, treats the audience with respect without being overly pretentious
1,"This movie's calm, steady control keeps a wide variety of good actors in the same universe."
1," As usual with Pixar, the film looks like a moving work of digital art, though its inordinate length might test the patience of six year olds who will love the brilliantly staged action but not all the exposition-heavy dialogue."
0," Soon blands out into the glib, ethnicky slapstick that is the regrettable stock in trade of Nia Vardolos."
1, The story is incredible.
0, It's one of those movies which are so desperate to become cult viewing that they feel no obligation to be any good.
1," It's virtually all Hemsworth's show and he's entirely up to the task of carrying the film on his broad shoulders: He's charismatic, fearless, confident, jokey and a good old Kentucky boy who just wants to get the job done ..."
1," An exhaustive, ruminative, angry and even occasionally gallows-humorous account of the strange domino effect of tragedy compounding incompetence compounding tragedy that dealt a critical blow to one of America's great cities."
0, The final segment is as cliched and as predictable as any of the many films that have chronicled the rise and fall of well-known musical figures.
0, It is a bland attempt of supernatural horror that becomes more and more embarrassing in every imaginable aspect. [Full review in Spanish]
0, Avoid at all costs.
0," Ultimately, it dashes into so many close-ups of carnage and neckbreaking, it skids scuzzily close to spy-snuff. Call this Bourne-porn; Safe House needed a safe word."
1," An intense mix of horror, thriller and domestic drama, this is exquisite filmmaking."
0, Gorgeously animated children's film about the mythical guardians of childhood just misses being magical.
1," It takes all of 10 minutes for Doremus' film to reveal itself to us: this is a movie about a conflicted father who has arrived at a crossroads, both morally and artistically."
0,"Despite the estimable talent on hand both behind and in front of the camera, the story never comes to convincing life and doesn't, in the end, have anywhere particularly surprising or interesting to go."
0," Mostly serves as an overwrought ""woe-is-me"" tale about a director in over her head."
0," Writer-director David Lowery strains for poetry at every turn, and only the strain registers."
0, This is a movie about how watching movies is stupid.
0," I certainly wouldn't go so far as to call it a bad movie, it's just a movie that could have used a little improvement in the story department."
1, An utterly amazing and riveting start to a brand new beginning...
0," [A Cure For Wellness] doesn't just stretch the limits of plausibility, it punches plausibility in the guts, pushes it into a river and waves goodbye."
0," Amirpour gives us little reason to care (apart from Miami Man's nice portraits of his daughter, maybe) and so, instead, I wondered: What if a person tried not to do terrible things?"
0," Stallone plopping Statham in this bore feels like an alpha setting up his successor to fail, like Zeus swallowing up his challengers before they force him into retirement."
0," Inorganic and implausible, this Bollywood-inflected rom-com features little comedy and even less romance."
0, All the people of Chuck & Buck feel very human.
0, Suffers from bouts of listlessness and lackluster writing.
0," Too bad, though, that The Crucible fails to probe deeper into the sexual, religious, and political conditions that can give false accusations so much power -- even today."
1," Though ""Thor: Ragnarok"" may feel like a lightweight entertainment, it comes packed with the same ingredients that made Whedon's ""The Avengers"" so good."
0," For those with a burning curiosity to know how The Lord of the Rings as directed by Michael Bay might look, Wrath of the Titans provides an idea."
1," A superb, impassioned concert film."
1," Though Nixey carries it across with some style, some intensity, and some graphic imagination, the whole isn't quite the sum of its somes."
0,"There are some funny and charming lines, but the film is overlong and it rambles a bit."
0,It fumbles a bit by prioritizing the goofy antics of its white cast over what turns out to be a smart depiction of non-Western life.
0," ufus Sewell and Rupert Graves do add some thespian punch as the intrepid video director and the pampered producer, but it's not nearly enough to keep this one from extremely bombing."
0, The film is strictly by-the-numbers slasher boilerplate. It won't endure past the weekend.
0," We're told what we already know and ultimately, the film's two lead characters remain its most elusive ..."
0," Unnecessarily gloomy and emotionally convoluted, Spike Jonze and Dave Eggers' script for Where the Wild Things Are is a melancholy adaptation of the one-two punch that is the heavily illustrated, scantly written book by Maurice Sendak. "
1, A narrative shapeshifter that gleefully toys with its audience's perception of love and themselves.
0," Rather than reasoned thought and debate, the only thing this movie inspires is exasperation."
1," A quick, efficient thriller that gets right to the point."
0," 'God is punishing me,' says the matriarch. Not just you."
1," Greene has made a hard movie to argue with, even as he invites you to do exactly that."
1," Star Chris Pratt says it best, 'It's adventure, it's romance, it's a thriller, it's scary, but it's emotionally resonant.' Amen. Once you accept the premise, with good acting and special effects, this is a terrific way to spend two hours."
0," It is as if The Sunlit Night aims to be unconventional merely for the sake of it. It has all of the dressings of a lovable indie, complete with the unusual setting and affable feel, but ultimately, it's structured in a way that fails to due it justice."
1," I like the idea of this, I like the look of this...It's kind of superficial, and I don't know [if] there's a whole lot of depth to whatever allegory this is intended to be. It's just an exercise in style, and that's cool. "
0, Rent Drop Dead Gorgeous if you want to see how a funny movie on the beauty pageant world is done! This is all formula.
1," Imagination is the real star of Sendak's classic and Jonze and his co-writer, Dave Eggers, have expanded on its brief text to spin a story in which the tough and the tender smoothly coalesce."
0," Given all the name-brand products invoked, their misadventure suggests a sort of nightmarish shopping spree."
1,Gallo's combination of crudeness and sophistication has a preternatural power.
1, This chick-lit flick is an 'English Patient' style epic.
0," Despite its continual profanity and sexual references, it isn't particularly offensive, just mostly forgettable."
1," [MacGruber is] a film that's easy to watch and consistently funny, even if it is as substantial as a merengue."
0," Almost nothing happens for long stretches before a plot ""twist"" so obvious that only the dull-witted could fail to see it coming."
0," By trying to recapture the magic of the original, Neighbors 2 has disproved the existence of magic."
0," Farhadi's films are suffused with an oppressive atmosphere, and there is something increasingly formulaic in his storytelling."
0," If forced to choose, skip Night School -- a remedial-level comedy with Kevin Hart [and Tiffany Haddish]."
1," Romantic comedies are a staple of popular cinema and I Love You, Man follows a familiar trajectory, but in a refreshingly different way."
0," Wild Target neatly and boringly makes a surrogate family out of its ill-matched trio of caricatures, and its epilogue of domesticity is enough to make you reach for your revolver."
0," Two directors and six writers, and all they had to do was find an excuse for the kind of party scene that happens only in lame-brained movies like this. Is this the best they could come up with, really?"
1, Co-writer and director Billy O'Brien does a masterful job of building up the creep factor but gets too ambitious in the second half of the story.
1," A fascinating and intoxicating tale of cannibalism that examines the savage sexual awakening of a shy adolescent, whose complex psychology and inner struggle are described with great delicacy. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0, There's nothing remotely redeeming about this film. Watch this at your own risk.
0," ...unfortunately for Marfa Girl 2, physicality is favoured over soul and [Clark's] characters continue to not care about their lives, so why should we either?"
1, Subjects that would seem like rom-com contrivance in lesser movies are sturdy and thoughtful here. It's a well-filled romance.
0, The film just glumly proceeds.
1," The story's time-travel elements never quite make sense, but subtle performances and directing give this film an unexpected edge."
0," To his credit, Langenegger keeps things relatively simple instead of resorting to lots of fast cutting and fancy camera angles. To his detriment, the picture he has made barely moves at all."
0," Kids have seen much better animation in other films, and it's hard to imagine too many grown-ups ready to smile and nod at yet more smirking takes on famous moments from Scarface and The Silence Of The Lambs."
1," Consistently warm, and in moments savvy and irreverent, this feminist day trip of Asian immigrants to a British searesort contains some lurid and funny fantasies staged in the colorful Bollywood style."
1, The Gospel According to Andr√© is the most essential fashion documentary since Bill Cunningham New York in 2010.
1," B.B. King. Bill Withers. Miriam Makeba. Celia Cruz. And James Brown, earning every inch of the title, ""Godfather of Soul,"" who all by himself probably deforested a few acres around Kinshasa with the volcanic blast of his set."
1," It illogically breezes by, even if much of the story shows our heroes doing little but hiding, fighting, and strategizing. "
1," Sure, we can nitpick things like Joe Colton not having a beard, or Roadblock not talking in rhyme, but the spirit of the property many of us loved in one form or another is there."
1," There are some great, brilliant action scenes, but this is more thoughtful and darker and more in the vein of Batman Begins. And that's a very good thing."
0," The loudest laughs in this ""serious comedy"" came from three brief appearances by author Salman Rushdie as a doctor."
1," A solid-enough L.A. noir whose hook, and albatross, is the transformation of a beautiful Oscar-winning actress into a desiccated crone."
1,"Neither revolutionary in its approach or subject matter nor seamless in its storytelling, Billy Elliot nevertheless manages to sketch the lives of characters we come to care about."
0," The whole thing is a big mess, but sometimes it is an amusing mess -- and doubly so once Cage shows up. Bless his heart."
0," Affleck has talent behind the camera, so much I can't wait to see what he's got up his sleeve next, but even with that being so his latest cinematic heist is in the end one I didn't want to remain a part of."
0, Ewan McGregor's inert adaption smooths out the Philip Roth novel's eruptions of self-loathing and doubt. 
1," God Help the Girl is a smart, powerful little flick. Sometimes I hated it. But I won't forget it."
0," Perhaps ""perversely watchable"" might be the right term to describe the film."
1," Blue Jasmine captures a manic and delusional woman attempting to rebuild herself after a prodigal life she received, but never deserved."
1," It's clear that this portrait of a sick society is meant to explain, at least partially, the horrendous war that breaks out at the very end of the film, and the fascism that quickly followed in its wake."
0," If not entirely a downer, this is no topper."
1,"Confident, uncompromising and blisteringly realistic, Sweet Sixteen is a gritty and immediate film yet it goes right to the emotions."
1," Torres's...writing is blunt and evocative, like poetry turned prose. The new film adaptation of the book by director Jeremiah Zagar turns the story back into poetry again."
1," Storytelling in its purest form: it works as a no-fat thriller, yet it achieves nuanced character dimension and thematic complexity"
0, Shana Feste's pot-slinging cross-country road-trip dramedy deals in paternal disappointment and familial reconciliation but remains a bit high on its own supply.
1," People cynically walk into so much expecting disappointment - auditoriums showing Woody Allen's annual crapshoot, for example. Sometimes, they get expected middling results. Sometimes, as with Allen's 30-year-old script, they get unanticipated surprises."
1, A meticulously researched and ably handled chronicle of one of the largest corporate scandals in American history.
1, Michael Douglas with his giant crazy man stare and beard to match is quite funny.
1," Despite a nagging sensation about its shortcomings, the acting and the atmospherics continue to haunt me."
0," It telegraphs its ineptness at the outset with saccharine ""slice of life"" dialogue. With little chemistry between Witherspoon and Ruffalo it dismally failed the watch test."
0, The filmmakers aren't really interested in the space between what these women say and what they mean.
1, It's clear that Mbatha-Raw is a precocious talent.
0," It's better than The Bounty Hunter, with the two leads making a more charming couple than Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler, but it's still difficult to view Killers as anything more than throwaway fluff."
1, The two leads manage to carry the day through sheer gumption.
0, There's no heart to be found amid the guts.
1," Its initial enigma seems to need no explanation; yet, once deciphered, the film does not falter but moves only deeper into the emotional territory it charts."
0," The shortcuts are maddening, but so is Spread as a whole. Just because the lead character is an insipid, mean-spirited waste of time doesn't mean the movie has to follow suit."
0," Easy, quick and utterly forgettable."
1, The rampaging reptile is back to remind us that monsters have meaning.
1," Marjorie Prime is ultimately more about its ideas than its characters, but that's OK, because they're fascinating ideas. "
0," ... a shaggy-dog version of a Jack London story, enhanced with an animatronic leopard seal that looks like Charlie the Tuna."
1, It's so much fun that it's easy to overlook the film's rather conventional plot arc.
0," Here's that J. Edgar Hoover biopic you asked for, or at least something that meets all the technical requirements to be considered one."
1," It's nice to see the always compelling Hawke - here, tenser and more laconic than ever - in a role where his face's deep stress lines come into their own."
0, Even Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli wizardry can't ward off this story's jinxes.
1," This is a delightful movie, funny, absurd, anarchic and profound. "
1," One would have to invoke supernatural influences to make it believable, and that is pretty much what is being invoked."
0,"There is a moment in ""The Tourist"" when Johnny Depp turns to Angelina Jolie and asks ""Why is all this happening?"" It's a question moviegoers will be asking themselves as well."
0," Borrowing (or repackaging) liberally from 20th century musical titans, La La Land often appears drunk on nostalgia... It's a traditionalist that so longs to be a revolutionary, but not really. "
0," Someday, when Mirren receives a lifetime achievement award, there will be a montage of her performances in great films. Winchester will not be a part of that montage."
1, A work of battered brilliance.
0, Inoffensively bland.
0," Alas, with the notable exception of the empathetic Boutella, the cast of Climax consists primarily of dancers who are not actors."
1," Mockingjay Part 2 is a fittingly dark end to the Hunger Games franchise, not as exciting perhaps as Catching Fire, but more politically charged."
1," As with fights, we understand at all times what we're seeing; Surprises aren't the result of whim or betrayal to the logic of the story. [Full review in Spanish]"
1,"Not only does the film effortlessly mock the sense of wonder and the emotional roller-coasters we've all felt watching Pixar's big-eyed sentient objects, but, in its own messed-up way, it provokes some new feelings, too: shock and awe ..."
0," Tusk, based on one of Kevin Smith's Smodcasts, smakes a strong case for a smintervention. "
1," No, it's no Fargo. It's the most flamboyant, erratic, spontaneous movie the Coens have ever made."
0," The filmic equivalent of a roofie: you're sure that something happened while you were out, but damned if you know what it was."
1," The movie is quite derivative, transplanting the familiar tropes of the fantasy genre onto owls. Still, I liked it well enough to endorse it for smaller children."
1,"... pay your money and take the ride,... laugh and ... be strangely moved by the odd-looking creatures Russell has assembled for his latest ensemble play."
0," For all its visual delights, Magic in the Moonlight, the 44th feature written and directed by the admirably industrious Woody Allen, has to be one of his bigger duds."
0," Once you get beyond nostalgia for dodging red balls whipped at your head, there's little here."
0," The scenery is spectacular and the food porn is fabulous, but what should be insouciant feels insipid in this stretched-out travelogue, mostly due to underwritten characters and awkward performances."
0, There's nothing much here for those outside the PG Disney Princess-aimed target market to sink their horns into.
0, It would be difficult to imagine material more wrong for Spade than Lost & Found.
1," Another exceptional piece of propaganda, designed to get you riled up, but also to get you to laugh."
0," The acting is pretty good, and the characters are interesting, but the screenplay lacks the imagination it takes to elevate this story above the ordinary, predictable level of a common ghost story. It doesn't help this was also done on the cheap."
0, A self-indulgent romp through standard Neapolitan stereotypes.
1," ...while it doesn't achieve the brilliance of the modern Batman franchise, and while it certainly has a few flaws... the action is undeniably well-done and there are still good character bits throughout."
1," I was afraid this was going to be another case where a greedy studio doing a book adaptation managed to screw things up by splitting a book in half, ending up with a movie with half a story, but this one works out O.K."
0," I didn't think it was possible to make a boring action film in New Orleans, but Bullet to the Head proved me wrong."
0," With its undertones of slavery and cockfighting, Pok√©mon"" may have the most unsavory premise ever for children's entertainment."
1," The film gets long in the tooth and it's ambition to be both dirty and touching spreads a solid story a little thin...but ""Trainwreck"" has so much in it to like, not the least of which is the future potential of more Amy Schumer/Judd Apatow collaborations."
0," Hide and Seek is a technically slicker paranoid thriller than director John Polson's previous Swimfan, but its esteemed posture makes it even trashier."
1," It's rare for a film about a Mexican drug cartel and the impossibility of the American Dream to be either disarming or funny, but Clint Eastwood has blessedly delivered one that is consistently both."
1, It's an example of a clever actress taking control of her career.
1, The film delivers laughs and heart and some strong ideas and energy...
1," An attractive and robust screen adaptation of the classic 1861 Dickens parable of false hopes, thwarted vanities and the mysterious workings of sowing and reaping."
0, Maybe something this surreal needs unknowns to keep it in the ether.
0," A midnight movie for those fine with dozing off about twenty minutes in, once the charm of its single sentence log-line has worn off."
0, Even the publicity geeks can't convincingly milk as exhausted a teat as X-Men.
0, Those who buy into the peculiar superstition that only the even-numbered Star Trek movies are any good will find their belief system strongly challenged by Star Trek: Nemesis.
1," ...a perfectly tuned sense of character nuance [that] holds you more spellbound than 90 percent of Hollywood's ""crowd-pleasers."""
1," Rugrats again blends poignancy with fun in a way that touches parents, even as it goes for kids with a run of bodily function and booger jokes."
0," If anything, the release of ""The Predator"" is a great excuse to re-watch the original."
1," The Adventures of Tintin can be a delight to look at, even if motion capture isn't your particular cup of animation tea."
1," Fusing the personal and the political, Bouchareb's stirring war drama comes with a modern-day resonance and plenty of punch. Recommended."
1," Vicky Cristina Barcelona, which Allen wrote and directed but did not act in, is Woody at the top of his game."
1," Combining, as Meyers films do, pleasant fantasy with aspirational settings. I know I'll watch it again when it comes on cable, or if I have the flu or need to fold laundry."
1," An epic, evocative of another epoch and of landscapes beyond time."
0," Walking out of the movie I was mostly disappointed, since I felt that there was something there that could've been great, but instead was ho-hum."
1," A bombastic three-hour saga that moves like a 1,000-page book left idle in front of a window fan."
1," The film never stops moving, and it's always a pleasure to watch."
1,"The ultimate destination creates the opportunity for Penn to draw up a summation for his protagonist's journey, and it's a moral that should satisfy those viewers looking for meaning and order."
1," Before taking a dark swerve into chilling verit√© at the close, BlacKkKlansman ... kicks up suggestions of the pilot for a great 1970s mismatched cop show. It's that funky."
0," An emotionally empty, thematically ill-defined, and listless affair. It is never able to communicate the complexity of the woman at its center."
0," A shoddy and indulgent mass of bits from other movies with a shapeless, shameless performance by British comedic actor Steve Coogan as its unfixed center."
1," The film teases us with a paradox: arguably Nim's keepers were wrong to try to endow their protege with human attributes, but can we empathise with his suffering without making the same mistake?"
0," Jamais consegue oferecer qualquer tipo de resposta para perguntas obviamente importantes em uma biografia como esta, a come√ßar pela mais relevante: quem era este homem?"
1," If you watched all of the ""Mission: Impossible"" films in a row, starting with 1996's original, would they feel like a James Bond version of ""Boyhood""? Maybe."
1," Jordan Peele has made something scathing, hilarious, and -- as unlikely as this may sound -- totally fresh. I am pleased -- who am I kidding? I'm f----g thrilled -- to announce that Get Out is a legitimately great movie."
1, A warm and moving sleeper hit.
1, It's a powerful drama that works on a couple of levels.
1," It's a great subject, with great objects of fascination, study, interpretation."
0, What still eludes Burton is the ability to deepen the superficial allure of his visions.
0," A strong supporting cast also does good work, and the film -- as is the case of all Egoyan's films -- is made with smooth professionalism. It's a pity that it increasingly strays into the direction of almost laughable improbability."
0," Youngsters will no doubt flock to see it, which is a good thing, only if it keeps them out of traffic."
1," An action thriller that, while flawed, still reminds us that, if he really wanted to, The Rock could still become the next Schwarzenegger."
1," The specter of [John] Hughes is all over this entertaining, clever, and finally heartwarming comedy."
1," In these linked vignettes, Another Year paints an empathetic portrait of working-class contentment and anxiety."
1," First and foremost...the reason to go see ""Blue Crush"" is the phenomenal, water-born cinematography by David Hennings."
0," [Christopher] Doyle remains a distinctive cinematographer, even if his directing here is ultimately disappointing."
0, The dialogue is so bad it's kind of terrific; the movie has a particular camp appeal that may well win it a cult following.
1," At its best, Tropic Thunder skewers impotent directors, fascist producers, prima donna stars and classic scenes from the camo-fatigues genre."
1," A meticulously shot and sharply written character study, it plays like a blend of the Coen brothers and Quentin Tarantino."
1," The acting is very convincing by Hoss and Zehrfeld. Writer-Director Christian Petzold (""Barbara"") has crafted a compelling ghost story about a woman, thought to be dead, who gets a chance to see what people really thought about her."
0, A dark and often unattractive movie.
0,Its supposedly innovative epic style looks decidedly old-fashioned here.
0," In the Heart of the Sea is neither history nor myth but a hokey, unworkable Hollywood mix of the two."
1," Exciting, provocative genre cinema."
1," The humor is spot on, and the film drew some genuine laughs from me, especially the scene with Richie and the cricket bat."
1," The sins of fathers, sons and lovers come pouring onto the audience in a torrent of stifling intensity."
0, Why do so many horror movies that begin with promise fall apart in the final act?
0," It's a deeply unpleasant picture, all the more offensive for its veneer of comedy, stretched ever-more thinly over a carnival of brutality."
1," Endhiran -- The Robot provides maximum bang for its reported $34 million budget with a sensationally overstated and overwhelming mash-up of American-style, f/x-driven sci-fi spectacle and exuberant Bollywood-style songs, dance and romance."
1," A perfectly enjoyable exercise in superheroics, and much more fun to watch than 'Man of Steel'."
0," Other than a few droll period references and a handsomely evoked, quaintly drab early 1960s Paris, there's little else to distinguish this heavy-handed romantic comedy."
1,Delivers the goods as a zippy piece of sci-fi pulp.
1," A sometimes scathing, sometimes goodnatured satire of the French film industry."
1," ""The Exception"" is a diverting and occasionally exciting film, though it is rarely disturbing or thought-provoking in ways the material might require."
1," Elliot's record of an unconventional friendship revels in grotesque detail and scatological humour, but yields unexpected depth and poignancy."
0, Stick with Twister.
0, Why is goodhearted liberal cinema sometimes so dumb?
1, A gift of a documentary.
0," A fitful, effects-driven and remarkably unambitious summer release about a midget jewel thief masquerading as a baby."
0," McPherson's good actors remind you how stage plays generate interest solely through talk and, as The Eclipse gets further away from cinema, a bigger mystery develops: Why is McPherson's filmmaking so uncinematic?"
1, [An] affecting study of independence and friendship.
1," As one might expect from a zombie romance, the film doesn't pack a lot of big ideas. Still, the concept is original, and watching it unfold is loads of fun."
0," Unless you're a 15-year-old boy who thinks motorcycle racing on dirt tracks is the 'next big thing,' you may ignore the release of Supercross."
0," ... a myth in need of a makeover - but not this one. So little of Arthurian legend is preserved that this could be any blade swinger since Conan. No Guinevere, minimal Mordred and Merlin gets only a mention. Not a lotta Camelot."
0," As a comedy, The Man resembles a photo negative of Midnight Run, opposite in every possible way."
1," Watching Carell and Fey in action, trading quips and dodging gunfire as they attempt to make their way home to white-picket-fence suburbia, makes you wonder why it's taken so long to bring these two gifted comics together."
0, John needs to move on and leave Lara behind as the Next Three Days felt like three years. 
0," Exorcist: The Beginning makes the mistake of confusing loud noises, grotesque images, obscene violence, and buckets of blood for frights."
1," Fincher's strange romantic epic has its greatest impact the first time around. Overall, the film seems more like a beautiful curio than anything else, a sort of artsy fartsy Forest Gump."
1," It's exciting, foreboding, grand and important, a part of our culture and identity no matter how loudly cineastes scream bloody murder."
0," Rats has little of interest to say about its subject, little to provoke thought or argument, beyond which mode of death one finds more vile, or more unjustifiable as viewing material."
1, City of Men has the electrically oversaturated style of reality that made City of God such a searing vision of teenage criminal life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro.
1, ... a unique and engaging reworking of an enduring genre.
1, Depicts a side of Abraham Lincoln and the American political system that is equally stimulating and intellectually inspiring.
1, Slick and playful entertainment that remains carefully inoffensive beneath its veneer of bad manners.
1, The changes suit the demands of mainstream cinema and the warm aesthetic Batra exhibited in his first film. This is a smart piece of translation.
1," It's an exciting experience, dazzling and entertaining and thought-provoking."
1," The actors make these characters vivid, within a structure that is recognisably Malick's."
1, It's impossible to tell the experienced from the inexperienced among Loach's casts.
1,"Absorbing, often electric with the energy of the playing field, Invictus is packed with feel-good ""teachable moments"" without the sugary aftertaste."
0, Routine post-9/11 espionage thriller than leans far too heavily on ticks taken from far better Hitchcock films.
0,"...with more attention paid to shock than to storytelling, the violence and incredulity take the front seat..."
1," The film definitely has its moments, and at arm's length, The Promise will resonate. But overall, it feels like a missed opportunity, a good film that could have been much better."
1," The film builds steadily, but never tediously, to the long awaited mission to Abbottabad and the compound housing Osama bin Laden."
1,An entertaining comedy that far surpasses his previous American films.
1, There are definitely sentimental and predictable moments but it is enjoyable.
0," Friday Night Lights is a feel-good movie, but it's not real. It's a hard-hitting Hallmark greeting card. It's no wonder it appealed to Larry King %u2014 it's safe, easy, conventional, and feigns incisiveness."
0, The only thing keeping this movie from completely driving off the road is Alfre Woodard.
0, Makes the similarly themed Love Story seem positively sophisticated by comparison.
1," Hail, Caesar gives us a colourful feast full of excess and fun."
