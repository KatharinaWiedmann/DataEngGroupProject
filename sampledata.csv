0, Parental Content Review
1, Director Wayne Wang proves with Maid in Manhattan that even predictable movies can leave you feeling warm and fuzzy.
0, the lack of dramatic development doesn't leave much for the actors to work with
1, A riveting documentary that explains education and the violent changes that are rocking Pakistan.
0," The problem with The Informant!, aside from that overcoaxing exclamation mark, is that it's not especially funny."
0, Too tepid and too predictable of a picture to simply sail away into the sunset.
0, Bernie lacks the edge of malice one might reasonably expect from so nasty a tale.
0, Simply one of the poorest entertainments ever offered up to the world's children.
0," More drab ""fi"" than dreamy ""sci."""
1," With its emphasis on nature and its mudbound farmers, this beautifully crafted film recalls other earthly European historical dramas set in an isolated countryside."
1," It's not like having a real film of Nijinsky, but at least it's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered."
1,"The intelligently observed and staggeringly beautiful Italian foreign-language Oscar nominee is about life, death and the search for the things that give meaning to both."
0, Yields at least two spectacular scenes... The rest is a little more uneven. 
0," The 'Mr. Holland's Opus' meets 'Rocky II' story will satisfy some who long for innocuous content, even those who know James deserves better material."
0," The Lawnmower Man, Max Headroom and Johnny Depp walk into a bar. They get drunk and decide to make a movie."
1, The Cell's striking visuals along with its fantastical costumes absolutely mesmerize the viewers.
0, Director Takashi Miike's dish of sukiyaki spaghetti ala Sergio Corbucci is badly seasoned with scraps of reservoir dogs.
1, [House of Wax] gleefully trots out all the clich√©s of the genre before going out in a blaze of glory with a truly spectacular final act.
1, treats the audience with respect without being overly pretentious
1,"This movie's calm, steady control keeps a wide variety of good actors in the same universe."
1," As usual with Pixar, the film looks like a moving work of digital art, though its inordinate length might test the patience of six year olds who will love the brilliantly staged action but not all the exposition-heavy dialogue."
0," Soon blands out into the glib, ethnicky slapstick that is the regrettable stock in trade of Nia Vardolos."
1, The story is incredible.
0, It's one of those movies which are so desperate to become cult viewing that they feel no obligation to be any good.
1," It's virtually all Hemsworth's show and he's entirely up to the task of carrying the film on his broad shoulders: He's charismatic, fearless, confident, jokey and a good old Kentucky boy who just wants to get the job done ..."
1," An exhaustive, ruminative, angry and even occasionally gallows-humorous account of the strange domino effect of tragedy compounding incompetence compounding tragedy that dealt a critical blow to one of America's great cities."
0, The final segment is as cliched and as predictable as any of the many films that have chronicled the rise and fall of well-known musical figures.
0, It is a bland attempt of supernatural horror that becomes more and more embarrassing in every imaginable aspect. [Full review in Spanish]
0, Avoid at all costs.
0," Ultimately, it dashes into so many close-ups of carnage and neckbreaking, it skids scuzzily close to spy-snuff. Call this Bourne-porn; Safe House needed a safe word."
1," An intense mix of horror, thriller and domestic drama, this is exquisite filmmaking."
0, Gorgeously animated children's film about the mythical guardians of childhood just misses being magical.
1," It takes all of 10 minutes for Doremus' film to reveal itself to us: this is a movie about a conflicted father who has arrived at a crossroads, both morally and artistically."
0,"Despite the estimable talent on hand both behind and in front of the camera, the story never comes to convincing life and doesn't, in the end, have anywhere particularly surprising or interesting to go."
0," Mostly serves as an overwrought ""woe-is-me"" tale about a director in over her head."
0," Writer-director David Lowery strains for poetry at every turn, and only the strain registers."
0, This is a movie about how watching movies is stupid.
0," I certainly wouldn't go so far as to call it a bad movie, it's just a movie that could have used a little improvement in the story department."
1, An utterly amazing and riveting start to a brand new beginning...
0," [A Cure For Wellness] doesn't just stretch the limits of plausibility, it punches plausibility in the guts, pushes it into a river and waves goodbye."
0," Amirpour gives us little reason to care (apart from Miami Man's nice portraits of his daughter, maybe) and so, instead, I wondered: What if a person tried not to do terrible things?"
0," Stallone plopping Statham in this bore feels like an alpha setting up his successor to fail, like Zeus swallowing up his challengers before they force him into retirement."
0," Inorganic and implausible, this Bollywood-inflected rom-com features little comedy and even less romance."
0, All the people of Chuck & Buck feel very human.
0, Suffers from bouts of listlessness and lackluster writing.
0," Too bad, though, that The Crucible fails to probe deeper into the sexual, religious, and political conditions that can give false accusations so much power -- even today."
1," Though ""Thor: Ragnarok"" may feel like a lightweight entertainment, it comes packed with the same ingredients that made Whedon's ""The Avengers"" so good."
0," For those with a burning curiosity to know how The Lord of the Rings as directed by Michael Bay might look, Wrath of the Titans provides an idea."
1," A superb, impassioned concert film."
1," Though Nixey carries it across with some style, some intensity, and some graphic imagination, the whole isn't quite the sum of its somes."
0,"There are some funny and charming lines, but the film is overlong and it rambles a bit."
0,It fumbles a bit by prioritizing the goofy antics of its white cast over what turns out to be a smart depiction of non-Western life.
0," ufus Sewell and Rupert Graves do add some thespian punch as the intrepid video director and the pampered producer, but it's not nearly enough to keep this one from extremely bombing."
0, The film is strictly by-the-numbers slasher boilerplate. It won't endure past the weekend.
0," We're told what we already know and ultimately, the film's two lead characters remain its most elusive ..."
0," Unnecessarily gloomy and emotionally convoluted, Spike Jonze and Dave Eggers' script for Where the Wild Things Are is a melancholy adaptation of the one-two punch that is the heavily illustrated, scantly written book by Maurice Sendak. "
1, A narrative shapeshifter that gleefully toys with its audience's perception of love and themselves.
0," Rather than reasoned thought and debate, the only thing this movie inspires is exasperation."
1," A quick, efficient thriller that gets right to the point."
0," 'God is punishing me,' says the matriarch. Not just you."
1," Greene has made a hard movie to argue with, even as he invites you to do exactly that."
1," Star Chris Pratt says it best, 'It's adventure, it's romance, it's a thriller, it's scary, but it's emotionally resonant.' Amen. Once you accept the premise, with good acting and special effects, this is a terrific way to spend two hours."
0," It is as if The Sunlit Night aims to be unconventional merely for the sake of it. It has all of the dressings of a lovable indie, complete with the unusual setting and affable feel, but ultimately, it's structured in a way that fails to due it justice."
1," I like the idea of this, I like the look of this...It's kind of superficial, and I don't know [if] there's a whole lot of depth to whatever allegory this is intended to be. It's just an exercise in style, and that's cool. "
0, Rent Drop Dead Gorgeous if you want to see how a funny movie on the beauty pageant world is done! This is all formula.
1," Imagination is the real star of Sendak's classic and Jonze and his co-writer, Dave Eggers, have expanded on its brief text to spin a story in which the tough and the tender smoothly coalesce."
0," Given all the name-brand products invoked, their misadventure suggests a sort of nightmarish shopping spree."
1,Gallo's combination of crudeness and sophistication has a preternatural power.
1, This chick-lit flick is an 'English Patient' style epic.
0," Despite its continual profanity and sexual references, it isn't particularly offensive, just mostly forgettable."
1," [MacGruber is] a film that's easy to watch and consistently funny, even if it is as substantial as a merengue."
0," Almost nothing happens for long stretches before a plot ""twist"" so obvious that only the dull-witted could fail to see it coming."
0," By trying to recapture the magic of the original, Neighbors 2 has disproved the existence of magic."
0," Farhadi's films are suffused with an oppressive atmosphere, and there is something increasingly formulaic in his storytelling."
0," If forced to choose, skip Night School -- a remedial-level comedy with Kevin Hart [and Tiffany Haddish]."
1," Romantic comedies are a staple of popular cinema and I Love You, Man follows a familiar trajectory, but in a refreshingly different way."
0," Wild Target neatly and boringly makes a surrogate family out of its ill-matched trio of caricatures, and its epilogue of domesticity is enough to make you reach for your revolver."
0," Two directors and six writers, and all they had to do was find an excuse for the kind of party scene that happens only in lame-brained movies like this. Is this the best they could come up with, really?"
1, Co-writer and director Billy O'Brien does a masterful job of building up the creep factor but gets too ambitious in the second half of the story.
1," A fascinating and intoxicating tale of cannibalism that examines the savage sexual awakening of a shy adolescent, whose complex psychology and inner struggle are described with great delicacy. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0, There's nothing remotely redeeming about this film. Watch this at your own risk.
0," ...unfortunately for Marfa Girl 2, physicality is favoured over soul and [Clark's] characters continue to not care about their lives, so why should we either?"
1, Subjects that would seem like rom-com contrivance in lesser movies are sturdy and thoughtful here. It's a well-filled romance.
0, The film just glumly proceeds.
1," The story's time-travel elements never quite make sense, but subtle performances and directing give this film an unexpected edge."
0," To his credit, Langenegger keeps things relatively simple instead of resorting to lots of fast cutting and fancy camera angles. To his detriment, the picture he has made barely moves at all."
0," Kids have seen much better animation in other films, and it's hard to imagine too many grown-ups ready to smile and nod at yet more smirking takes on famous moments from Scarface and The Silence Of The Lambs."
1," Consistently warm, and in moments savvy and irreverent, this feminist day trip of Asian immigrants to a British searesort contains some lurid and funny fantasies staged in the colorful Bollywood style."
1, The Gospel According to Andr√© is the most essential fashion documentary since Bill Cunningham New York in 2010.
1," B.B. King. Bill Withers. Miriam Makeba. Celia Cruz. And James Brown, earning every inch of the title, ""Godfather of Soul,"" who all by himself probably deforested a few acres around Kinshasa with the volcanic blast of his set."
1," It illogically breezes by, even if much of the story shows our heroes doing little but hiding, fighting, and strategizing. "
1," Sure, we can nitpick things like Joe Colton not having a beard, or Roadblock not talking in rhyme, but the spirit of the property many of us loved in one form or another is there."
1," There are some great, brilliant action scenes, but this is more thoughtful and darker and more in the vein of Batman Begins. And that's a very good thing."
0," The loudest laughs in this ""serious comedy"" came from three brief appearances by author Salman Rushdie as a doctor."
1," A solid-enough L.A. noir whose hook, and albatross, is the transformation of a beautiful Oscar-winning actress into a desiccated crone."
1,"Neither revolutionary in its approach or subject matter nor seamless in its storytelling, Billy Elliot nevertheless manages to sketch the lives of characters we come to care about."
0," The whole thing is a big mess, but sometimes it is an amusing mess -- and doubly so once Cage shows up. Bless his heart."
0," Affleck has talent behind the camera, so much I can't wait to see what he's got up his sleeve next, but even with that being so his latest cinematic heist is in the end one I didn't want to remain a part of."
0, Ewan McGregor's inert adaption smooths out the Philip Roth novel's eruptions of self-loathing and doubt. 
1," God Help the Girl is a smart, powerful little flick. Sometimes I hated it. But I won't forget it."
0," Perhaps ""perversely watchable"" might be the right term to describe the film."
1," Blue Jasmine captures a manic and delusional woman attempting to rebuild herself after a prodigal life she received, but never deserved."
1," It's clear that this portrait of a sick society is meant to explain, at least partially, the horrendous war that breaks out at the very end of the film, and the fascism that quickly followed in its wake."
0," If not entirely a downer, this is no topper."
1,"Confident, uncompromising and blisteringly realistic, Sweet Sixteen is a gritty and immediate film yet it goes right to the emotions."
1," Torres's...writing is blunt and evocative, like poetry turned prose. The new film adaptation of the book by director Jeremiah Zagar turns the story back into poetry again."
1," Storytelling in its purest form: it works as a no-fat thriller, yet it achieves nuanced character dimension and thematic complexity"
0, Shana Feste's pot-slinging cross-country road-trip dramedy deals in paternal disappointment and familial reconciliation but remains a bit high on its own supply.
1," People cynically walk into so much expecting disappointment - auditoriums showing Woody Allen's annual crapshoot, for example. Sometimes, they get expected middling results. Sometimes, as with Allen's 30-year-old script, they get unanticipated surprises."
1, A meticulously researched and ably handled chronicle of one of the largest corporate scandals in American history.
1, Michael Douglas with his giant crazy man stare and beard to match is quite funny.
1," Despite a nagging sensation about its shortcomings, the acting and the atmospherics continue to haunt me."
0," It telegraphs its ineptness at the outset with saccharine ""slice of life"" dialogue. With little chemistry between Witherspoon and Ruffalo it dismally failed the watch test."
0, The filmmakers aren't really interested in the space between what these women say and what they mean.
1, It's clear that Mbatha-Raw is a precocious talent.
0," It's better than The Bounty Hunter, with the two leads making a more charming couple than Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler, but it's still difficult to view Killers as anything more than throwaway fluff."
1, The two leads manage to carry the day through sheer gumption.
0, There's no heart to be found amid the guts.
1," Its initial enigma seems to need no explanation; yet, once deciphered, the film does not falter but moves only deeper into the emotional territory it charts."
0," The shortcuts are maddening, but so is Spread as a whole. Just because the lead character is an insipid, mean-spirited waste of time doesn't mean the movie has to follow suit."
0," Easy, quick and utterly forgettable."
1, The rampaging reptile is back to remind us that monsters have meaning.
1," Marjorie Prime is ultimately more about its ideas than its characters, but that's OK, because they're fascinating ideas. "
0," ... a shaggy-dog version of a Jack London story, enhanced with an animatronic leopard seal that looks like Charlie the Tuna."
1, It's so much fun that it's easy to overlook the film's rather conventional plot arc.
0," Here's that J. Edgar Hoover biopic you asked for, or at least something that meets all the technical requirements to be considered one."
1," It's nice to see the always compelling Hawke - here, tenser and more laconic than ever - in a role where his face's deep stress lines come into their own."
0, Even Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli wizardry can't ward off this story's jinxes.
1," This is a delightful movie, funny, absurd, anarchic and profound. "
1," One would have to invoke supernatural influences to make it believable, and that is pretty much what is being invoked."
0,"There is a moment in ""The Tourist"" when Johnny Depp turns to Angelina Jolie and asks ""Why is all this happening?"" It's a question moviegoers will be asking themselves as well."
0," Borrowing (or repackaging) liberally from 20th century musical titans, La La Land often appears drunk on nostalgia... It's a traditionalist that so longs to be a revolutionary, but not really. "
0," Someday, when Mirren receives a lifetime achievement award, there will be a montage of her performances in great films. Winchester will not be a part of that montage."
1, A work of battered brilliance.
0, Inoffensively bland.
0," Alas, with the notable exception of the empathetic Boutella, the cast of Climax consists primarily of dancers who are not actors."
1," Mockingjay Part 2 is a fittingly dark end to the Hunger Games franchise, not as exciting perhaps as Catching Fire, but more politically charged."
1," As with fights, we understand at all times what we're seeing; Surprises aren't the result of whim or betrayal to the logic of the story. [Full review in Spanish]"
1,"Not only does the film effortlessly mock the sense of wonder and the emotional roller-coasters we've all felt watching Pixar's big-eyed sentient objects, but, in its own messed-up way, it provokes some new feelings, too: shock and awe ..."
0," Tusk, based on one of Kevin Smith's Smodcasts, smakes a strong case for a smintervention. "
1," No, it's no Fargo. It's the most flamboyant, erratic, spontaneous movie the Coens have ever made."
0," The filmic equivalent of a roofie: you're sure that something happened while you were out, but damned if you know what it was."
1," The movie is quite derivative, transplanting the familiar tropes of the fantasy genre onto owls. Still, I liked it well enough to endorse it for smaller children."
1,"... pay your money and take the ride,... laugh and ... be strangely moved by the odd-looking creatures Russell has assembled for his latest ensemble play."
0," For all its visual delights, Magic in the Moonlight, the 44th feature written and directed by the admirably industrious Woody Allen, has to be one of his bigger duds."
0," Once you get beyond nostalgia for dodging red balls whipped at your head, there's little here."
0," The scenery is spectacular and the food porn is fabulous, but what should be insouciant feels insipid in this stretched-out travelogue, mostly due to underwritten characters and awkward performances."
0, There's nothing much here for those outside the PG Disney Princess-aimed target market to sink their horns into.
0, It would be difficult to imagine material more wrong for Spade than Lost & Found.
1," Another exceptional piece of propaganda, designed to get you riled up, but also to get you to laugh."
0," The acting is pretty good, and the characters are interesting, but the screenplay lacks the imagination it takes to elevate this story above the ordinary, predictable level of a common ghost story. It doesn't help this was also done on the cheap."
0, A self-indulgent romp through standard Neapolitan stereotypes.
1," ...while it doesn't achieve the brilliance of the modern Batman franchise, and while it certainly has a few flaws... the action is undeniably well-done and there are still good character bits throughout."
1," I was afraid this was going to be another case where a greedy studio doing a book adaptation managed to screw things up by splitting a book in half, ending up with a movie with half a story, but this one works out O.K."
0," I didn't think it was possible to make a boring action film in New Orleans, but Bullet to the Head proved me wrong."
0," With its undertones of slavery and cockfighting, Pok√©mon"" may have the most unsavory premise ever for children's entertainment."
1," The film gets long in the tooth and it's ambition to be both dirty and touching spreads a solid story a little thin...but ""Trainwreck"" has so much in it to like, not the least of which is the future potential of more Amy Schumer/Judd Apatow collaborations."
0," Hide and Seek is a technically slicker paranoid thriller than director John Polson's previous Swimfan, but its esteemed posture makes it even trashier."
1," It's rare for a film about a Mexican drug cartel and the impossibility of the American Dream to be either disarming or funny, but Clint Eastwood has blessedly delivered one that is consistently both."
1, It's an example of a clever actress taking control of her career.
1, The film delivers laughs and heart and some strong ideas and energy...
1," An attractive and robust screen adaptation of the classic 1861 Dickens parable of false hopes, thwarted vanities and the mysterious workings of sowing and reaping."
0, Maybe something this surreal needs unknowns to keep it in the ether.
0," A midnight movie for those fine with dozing off about twenty minutes in, once the charm of its single sentence log-line has worn off."
0, Even the publicity geeks can't convincingly milk as exhausted a teat as X-Men.
0, Those who buy into the peculiar superstition that only the even-numbered Star Trek movies are any good will find their belief system strongly challenged by Star Trek: Nemesis.
1," ...a perfectly tuned sense of character nuance [that] holds you more spellbound than 90 percent of Hollywood's ""crowd-pleasers."""
1," Rugrats again blends poignancy with fun in a way that touches parents, even as it goes for kids with a run of bodily function and booger jokes."
0," If anything, the release of ""The Predator"" is a great excuse to re-watch the original."
1," The Adventures of Tintin can be a delight to look at, even if motion capture isn't your particular cup of animation tea."
1," Fusing the personal and the political, Bouchareb's stirring war drama comes with a modern-day resonance and plenty of punch. Recommended."
1," Vicky Cristina Barcelona, which Allen wrote and directed but did not act in, is Woody at the top of his game."
1," Combining, as Meyers films do, pleasant fantasy with aspirational settings. I know I'll watch it again when it comes on cable, or if I have the flu or need to fold laundry."
1," An epic, evocative of another epoch and of landscapes beyond time."
0," Walking out of the movie I was mostly disappointed, since I felt that there was something there that could've been great, but instead was ho-hum."
1," A bombastic three-hour saga that moves like a 1,000-page book left idle in front of a window fan."
1," The film never stops moving, and it's always a pleasure to watch."
1,"The ultimate destination creates the opportunity for Penn to draw up a summation for his protagonist's journey, and it's a moral that should satisfy those viewers looking for meaning and order."
1," Before taking a dark swerve into chilling verit√© at the close, BlacKkKlansman ... kicks up suggestions of the pilot for a great 1970s mismatched cop show. It's that funky."
0," An emotionally empty, thematically ill-defined, and listless affair. It is never able to communicate the complexity of the woman at its center."
0," A shoddy and indulgent mass of bits from other movies with a shapeless, shameless performance by British comedic actor Steve Coogan as its unfixed center."
1," The film teases us with a paradox: arguably Nim's keepers were wrong to try to endow their protege with human attributes, but can we empathise with his suffering without making the same mistake?"
0," Jamais consegue oferecer qualquer tipo de resposta para perguntas obviamente importantes em uma biografia como esta, a come√ßar pela mais relevante: quem era este homem?"
1," If you watched all of the ""Mission: Impossible"" films in a row, starting with 1996's original, would they feel like a James Bond version of ""Boyhood""? Maybe."
1," Jordan Peele has made something scathing, hilarious, and -- as unlikely as this may sound -- totally fresh. I am pleased -- who am I kidding? I'm f----g thrilled -- to announce that Get Out is a legitimately great movie."
1, A warm and moving sleeper hit.
1, It's a powerful drama that works on a couple of levels.
1," It's a great subject, with great objects of fascination, study, interpretation."
0, What still eludes Burton is the ability to deepen the superficial allure of his visions.
0," A strong supporting cast also does good work, and the film -- as is the case of all Egoyan's films -- is made with smooth professionalism. It's a pity that it increasingly strays into the direction of almost laughable improbability."
0," Youngsters will no doubt flock to see it, which is a good thing, only if it keeps them out of traffic."
1," An action thriller that, while flawed, still reminds us that, if he really wanted to, The Rock could still become the next Schwarzenegger."
1," The specter of [John] Hughes is all over this entertaining, clever, and finally heartwarming comedy."
1," In these linked vignettes, Another Year paints an empathetic portrait of working-class contentment and anxiety."
1," First and foremost...the reason to go see ""Blue Crush"" is the phenomenal, water-born cinematography by David Hennings."
0," [Christopher] Doyle remains a distinctive cinematographer, even if his directing here is ultimately disappointing."
0, The dialogue is so bad it's kind of terrific; the movie has a particular camp appeal that may well win it a cult following.
1," At its best, Tropic Thunder skewers impotent directors, fascist producers, prima donna stars and classic scenes from the camo-fatigues genre."
1," A meticulously shot and sharply written character study, it plays like a blend of the Coen brothers and Quentin Tarantino."
1," The acting is very convincing by Hoss and Zehrfeld. Writer-Director Christian Petzold (""Barbara"") has crafted a compelling ghost story about a woman, thought to be dead, who gets a chance to see what people really thought about her."
0, A dark and often unattractive movie.
0,Its supposedly innovative epic style looks decidedly old-fashioned here.
0," In the Heart of the Sea is neither history nor myth but a hokey, unworkable Hollywood mix of the two."
1," Exciting, provocative genre cinema."
1," The humor is spot on, and the film drew some genuine laughs from me, especially the scene with Richie and the cricket bat."
1," The sins of fathers, sons and lovers come pouring onto the audience in a torrent of stifling intensity."
0, Why do so many horror movies that begin with promise fall apart in the final act?
0," It's a deeply unpleasant picture, all the more offensive for its veneer of comedy, stretched ever-more thinly over a carnival of brutality."
1," Endhiran -- The Robot provides maximum bang for its reported $34 million budget with a sensationally overstated and overwhelming mash-up of American-style, f/x-driven sci-fi spectacle and exuberant Bollywood-style songs, dance and romance."
1," A perfectly enjoyable exercise in superheroics, and much more fun to watch than 'Man of Steel'."
0," Other than a few droll period references and a handsomely evoked, quaintly drab early 1960s Paris, there's little else to distinguish this heavy-handed romantic comedy."
1,Delivers the goods as a zippy piece of sci-fi pulp.
1," A sometimes scathing, sometimes goodnatured satire of the French film industry."
1," ""The Exception"" is a diverting and occasionally exciting film, though it is rarely disturbing or thought-provoking in ways the material might require."
1," Elliot's record of an unconventional friendship revels in grotesque detail and scatological humour, but yields unexpected depth and poignancy."
0, Stick with Twister.
0, Why is goodhearted liberal cinema sometimes so dumb?
1, A gift of a documentary.
0," A fitful, effects-driven and remarkably unambitious summer release about a midget jewel thief masquerading as a baby."
0," McPherson's good actors remind you how stage plays generate interest solely through talk and, as The Eclipse gets further away from cinema, a bigger mystery develops: Why is McPherson's filmmaking so uncinematic?"
1, [An] affecting study of independence and friendship.
1," As one might expect from a zombie romance, the film doesn't pack a lot of big ideas. Still, the concept is original, and watching it unfold is loads of fun."
0," Unless you're a 15-year-old boy who thinks motorcycle racing on dirt tracks is the 'next big thing,' you may ignore the release of Supercross."
0," ... a myth in need of a makeover - but not this one. So little of Arthurian legend is preserved that this could be any blade swinger since Conan. No Guinevere, minimal Mordred and Merlin gets only a mention. Not a lotta Camelot."
0," As a comedy, The Man resembles a photo negative of Midnight Run, opposite in every possible way."
1," Watching Carell and Fey in action, trading quips and dodging gunfire as they attempt to make their way home to white-picket-fence suburbia, makes you wonder why it's taken so long to bring these two gifted comics together."
0, John needs to move on and leave Lara behind as the Next Three Days felt like three years. 
0," Exorcist: The Beginning makes the mistake of confusing loud noises, grotesque images, obscene violence, and buckets of blood for frights."
1," Fincher's strange romantic epic has its greatest impact the first time around. Overall, the film seems more like a beautiful curio than anything else, a sort of artsy fartsy Forest Gump."
1," It's exciting, foreboding, grand and important, a part of our culture and identity no matter how loudly cineastes scream bloody murder."
0," Rats has little of interest to say about its subject, little to provoke thought or argument, beyond which mode of death one finds more vile, or more unjustifiable as viewing material."
1, City of Men has the electrically oversaturated style of reality that made City of God such a searing vision of teenage criminal life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro.
1, ... a unique and engaging reworking of an enduring genre.
1, Depicts a side of Abraham Lincoln and the American political system that is equally stimulating and intellectually inspiring.
1, Slick and playful entertainment that remains carefully inoffensive beneath its veneer of bad manners.
1, The changes suit the demands of mainstream cinema and the warm aesthetic Batra exhibited in his first film. This is a smart piece of translation.
1," It's an exciting experience, dazzling and entertaining and thought-provoking."
1," The actors make these characters vivid, within a structure that is recognisably Malick's."
1, It's impossible to tell the experienced from the inexperienced among Loach's casts.
1,"Absorbing, often electric with the energy of the playing field, Invictus is packed with feel-good ""teachable moments"" without the sugary aftertaste."
0, Routine post-9/11 espionage thriller than leans far too heavily on ticks taken from far better Hitchcock films.
0,"...with more attention paid to shock than to storytelling, the violence and incredulity take the front seat..."
1," The film definitely has its moments, and at arm's length, The Promise will resonate. But overall, it feels like a missed opportunity, a good film that could have been much better."
1," The film builds steadily, but never tediously, to the long awaited mission to Abbottabad and the compound housing Osama bin Laden."
1,An entertaining comedy that far surpasses his previous American films.
1, There are definitely sentimental and predictable moments but it is enjoyable.
0," Friday Night Lights is a feel-good movie, but it's not real. It's a hard-hitting Hallmark greeting card. It's no wonder it appealed to Larry King %u2014 it's safe, easy, conventional, and feigns incisiveness."
0, The only thing keeping this movie from completely driving off the road is Alfre Woodard.
0, Makes the similarly themed Love Story seem positively sophisticated by comparison.
1," Hail, Caesar gives us a colourful feast full of excess and fun."
1, An inoffensive and relaxed offbeat comedy with just enough heart to carry it through.
1," Director Michael Polish and his co-scenarist and brother Mark don't fall into the trap of trying to redo Frank Capra. They have their own approach to the material, with an eye for the eccentric amid the commonplace adding just the right touch of humor."
1," The film's color photography is extraordinarily lovely for, like the conspirators within the film, Bertolucci has a weakness for the purely theatrical effect."
1," This is a modern day Capra movie, which means you might be embarrassed to tell your friends you went to see it, but you left the theater with a big smile on your face."
1," It's a story where, perhaps, there's enough guilt to go around. But the credit for telling it goes completely to a bright young talent."
0," The minus I give this children's story pains me...If I had seen this film when I was eight, I would have been terrified. "
0," Carl T. Evans's semi-autobiographical film is a modern-day Big Chill wannabe without the subtlety, humor, memorable soundtrack, strong performances or convincing dialogue."
1,Sam Peckinpah doesn't find anything to cheer about when his Man expresses his rage.
1, A true classic worthy of its highest praises.
1," ...we've seen all this before (""Bad Santa"" being but one example). Still, Murray is Murray and watching his sweetness peek through his outer curmudgeonly crust is worth the price of admission. More surprising is Naomi Watts..."
1," Even non-fans will get a thrill or two, followed by a quick laugh and a feeling like someone is trying to insult their intelligence."
1, A beautiful and shamelessly honest film about the fragility of life. [Full review in Spanish]
0, ...this could very well be the premise for an off-the-wall new sitcom...
0, The clich√©s are thick as the kudzu in 1956 Alabama.
0," Wild Grass is nearly the same movie as Amelie, only minus the charm and the appeal."
1," This 1930s-set drama chronicling events leading to the deportation of a little-known, real-life Irish political activist is a graceful digest of Loach's signature motifs."
0," Returning to Las Vegas but losing its winning streak, Ocean's Thirteen lets Soderbergh and the boys take a final bow while proving it is possible to have too much of a good thing."
0," Smith still has nothing to say, at least nothing printable, either as writer/director or as the dumb (as opposed to dumber) half of Jay and Silent Bob."
0," There is so much food, music, dancing and crying that you want to come out, at the end, and find a quiet place to watch paint dry. Unless, of course, you loved MBFGW1 and have spent 14 years waiting for MBFGW2."
0," Too much of it stretches credibility too far -- yes, even for a film designed to do just that -- and thus feels like the filmmakers took the easy way out and/or didn't have what it takes to make a smart, mindless movie. (Parental Review also Available)"
1," An examination of whether vigilante justice - no matter how well-intentioned at the start - is doomed, ultimately, to become just another example of would-be good guys falling prey to the lure of egotism and/or big money."
1," An authentic depiction of depression, mental illness, and a poetic meditation on mankind's relationship with the universe."
0," Well, Guy Ritchie sure put his stamp on this bit of British mythology. Lock, stock and flaming arrow."
1," The same effortless chemistry that made the comedians such ideal Golden Globes hosts is on full display in this broad comedy, given extra oomph by a wise and glorious R rating that opens the floodgates of creative vulgarity."
0," ""Skyscraper"" - part ""Die Hard,"" part Khalifa Tower sequence from ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol,"" part duct tape commercial - is patently absurd but never climbs to the heights of insanity it needs to transcend that and become something more."
1," Lovelace finds a fresh take on familiar material, but the film is also distinguished by its focus and intensity."
1," Nothing in Uncovered: The War on Iraq will change your opinion, but it may give you bullet points to back up your cocktail-party arguments."
0, Solamente una pel√≠cula m√°s en la filmograf√≠a de Tim Burton
1, The show is fun and fact-filled. A smart peak into how the past informs the present that does right by taking the funny stuff seriously.
1," It's often at its best when it's off on a moody tangent. But it has something and is well worth seeing, especially if you're a horror fan or a fan of art cinema"
1," Sure, it's complicated, but isn't that always true of romance? And doesn't it blow the hinges off the universe -- every single time?"
1," This incarnation of Fanny may not have been what Austen had in mind, but she surely would have approved, for the injection of attitude and smarts makes Mansfield Park a much more wicked and irresistible social satire..."
0," The film seems nearly writer-free. Absolutely no time gets wasted on story, character development or logic."
1," [Director Dome] Karukoski guides us on a journey of reflection, where distance is not so much geographic, but emotional. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, Seems mainly about ripping off 1983's Risky Business without attribution.
1, [Oliver] Stone uses a lot of visual effects to give some energy to a very conventional story...
1," There's nothing like seeing Fela himself - blowing his sax, expressing his unbridled sexuality and living a life like no other."
0," Just about every other element of Hits, from its eagerness to snigger at the expense of small-town yokels to its sneering disdain for YouTube, leaves a sour taste."
0," It's also incredibly uneven, visually overworked and frequently substitutes noisy kinetic action for actual narrative momentum."
0," Despite the incongruous romance and abrupt action beats, Crowe gives a likable, sympathetic performance. But it all starts to dry up before our eyes."
1, A rather watchable film that is reminiscent of The Bodyguard (sans the stalker sub-plot) that also works well as warm-hearted romance with soap opera elements.
0, It's got enough melodrama and full-volume diva-meltdown histrionics to blow a movie like Burlesque out of the water.
0," Not very good, but not the utter embarrassment some seem to have expected."
0," Just routine undeadliness that puts the ""stink"" in ""extinction."""
0," A bittersweet relationship story presented in a glass case, with an accompanying music box, but it doesn't really earn this treatment."
1,"What Black's movie really has going for it is pace. It starts with a crash, followed swiftly by a bang and vast swathes of wallop. The relentlessness doesn't allow you any time to catch a yawn, but it's also not too conducive to tension or suspense."
1," Real-life love stories rarely work out quite so faultlessly, but for two hours it's nice to believe that they could."
1," Another year, another mix of ""The Amityville Horror"" and ""The Exorcist."" Solid acting and an emotional back story set this one slightly apart."
1," While prone to arty lingering, thus wasting time that would have been more wisely spent plugging gaps in the narrative, Shortland slathers the story in enough mud and horror to make it a compellingly visceral experience."
1," Boasts the stock characters and situations, sentimentality, foreshadowing and melodrama of soap opera. Yet by cleverly blending these ingredients with those of an action caper, the pic presents a fresher appeal."
0," The reveal is eye-rollingly bad, a moment of affected profundity Michod's long, winding road trip never earns."
1," Well, it's a more fun trip to Rio than Rio. As the reckless flailing of a lot of meatheads, Fast Five is essentially a food fight with sloppy Joes."
1, The Secret World of Arrietty is a marvelously captivating animated feature about very tiny people and the full-scale world they inhabit.
1,"The Mambo Kings"" is so pumped up with life it threatens to burst. It's beautifully filmed and flashily edited. It pulsates with rhythmic ecstasy. It throbs, it sweats, it pounds, it undulates."
1, The film does not disappoint despite having moments where it could have more nuance. [Full Review in Spanish]
1," It's not the deepest movie of the season, but it has sprightly performances and cinematic style to spare."
0," Once upon a time, fairy tales were told with beauty, wit, simplicity and charm, a tradition that seems increasingly a thing of the past in Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil."
0, An annoying little film that attempts to be lascivious but is merely ludicrous.
0, I've never cheered so hard for the monster to win in my life.
0, Some stunning visuals -- and some staggeringly boring cinema.
1," It's almost as if the whole Peanuts universe has been encased in Carbonite, shipped to 2015, then unfrozen like Han Solo, ready for movie duty."
1, Manages to surprise and engage the viewer in a way you may not have expected.
1," As it stands, it's an efficient, diverting new entry in Neeson's ongoing action canon, albeit one which suggests his He-Man career route has finally reached the end of the line."
0, This film has Eric Roberts and Don 'The Dragon' Wilson straight-to-DVD written all over it.
0," There's no need for character assassination here. But the absence of darker, more contradictory revelations of his nature leaves Che bereft of complexity. All that remains is a South American superman: uncomplex, pure of heart, defiantly pious and boring."
1, Tim Burton magic with just a touch of scariness.
1,"If the thought of another Australian film with a soundtrack full of ABBA songs scares you away from this film, buck up and see it anyway."
0,The tone seems as uneven as the pacing.
1, A horror-fantasy that all involved should be wholeheartedly proud to be a part of.
0," Part ""Frankenstein,"" part ""Freaks,"" the horror film/cautionary tale ""Splice"" is derivative and disturbing."
1," From a philosophical viewpoint it's fitting that the inaugural movie to unite martial arts legends Jackie Chan and Jet Li is a fantasy film for young teenagers. Forbidden Kingdom"" may not be ""Enter the Dragon,"" but it's not supposed to be."
1, Even basketball-phobes will enjoy it.
1, A superhero tale that feels fresh and new...
1, Star Andy Samberg & Co. are at their best when they're deadpanning as addlepated celebrity man-children whose vision of the good life involves the getting of ways and the indulging of whims.
1, Lelio's observational and unobtrusive direction trusts the lead to carry the weight of the film. Moore characteristically rises to the occasion.
1," There is a sense that the picture ends just as it gets going. But it's a movie that understands co-dependency from the inside, as well as the helplessness and hopelessness of trying to cure someone else's addiction."
0," I am the prime demographic for this movie, and I found it only sort of inoffensively blah. Chris Pratt: He's no Jeff Goldblum."
0,Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's name is far more exciting than his movie...
1, Your response to all this depends extremely heavily on how much philosophizing and pretty pictures you're willing to accept in lieu of a story.
1, Stephen King's The Mist is a reminder of what a great horror movie is all about.
0," [Meryl] Streep doesn't play her as a crusader; twice Kay walks into boardrooms, a lone woman among grim men, making no impression."
0," I don't know how fans of the title hero are going to take this adaptation, since I'm not familiar with the classic Herg√© comic strip on which it's based, but followers of Steven Spielberg might regard it as a second-rate, animated Indiana Jones."
0," The We and the I is less a film than a social-studies experiment, an after-school project by a bunch of high-school kids exploring that eternal teen tension between the individual and the group. "
1," 3/4 is a small but ambitious drama with a perfectly symmetrical structure, using minimal means, nonprofessional actors, and everyday conversations to convey its characters' innermost feelings. "
0," Unfortunately, Fincher doesn't add much to Niels Arden Oplev's Swedish version: more Googling and plot-compressing montages and an altered but still convoluted ending."
1," Aaron Johnson may not be Lennon, but he?s entirely persuasive as someone who could have grown up to become him. It?s a striking pre-incarnation. "
1," Once you've been away from 'The Fall' for 24 hours or so, you reflect on its sheer beauty."
1, [F]eatures one of the most engaging ensemble casts I've seen in a goodly while... So hurrah for this band of gal pals at various romantic crossroads...
1, More of a dramatic freak-out than your standard teen slasher horror. Although the effect is exactly the same.
1, What Social Animals ultimately does is take us on a journey in order to see what Instagram users will do to be successful.
1,You can't help but walk out feeling as though you've just seen one of the more important stories about one of the more important people - gay or straight - of our time.
1," Ranks among the most mindless action films ever made, but scores as a helluva video game."
1," If you're not a fan of rocker David Crosby, director A.J. Eaton's comprehensive documentary ""David Crosby: Remember My Name"" might make you one - or at least give you an appreciation of this rock 'n' roll survivor."
0," By the time the story takes a dark turn towards ""war is bad"" lecturing, much of the loose, silly appeal of the early sequences fades into the white backgrounds. "
0, A romantic melodrama of a boringness to make your average tooth extraction seem preferable.
0," No, it's not as bad as you think. It's actually worse."
0," It's a film that carries on (carries on), but ultimately doesn't really matter. "
1, The first great film about the war in Iraq.
1, A deeply moving drama played out on the small stage of ordinary people's lives.
1," Iannucci made the bravura decision to make a factual film of that event dressed in the black robe of English satire at its darkest. Surely, there was no other intelligent way to bring the story to an audience 75 years after the event. "
0, The combination of Redford and Nick Nolte only manages to make this walk in the woods as exciting as a summer stroll.
1, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle breathes through its adventurous pores. [Full Review in Spanish] 
1," DeBlois, who also wrote the script, successfully juggles the multiple story lines, shifting allegiances and uncharted lands."
0," This movie just isn't good. The performances are all over the map, the central plot and action make no sense and there are huge chunks of screen time spent completely unnecessarily."
0," The film's one achievement is that it comprehensively discredits the concept of ""comedy violence"": the body count in the first 20 minutes leaves little room for guffaws."
1, Tedeschi combines the raw sensuality of an Anna Magnani with the melancholic introspection of a Monica Vitti and is well worth discovering.
1, Bulworth plays like a cry of frustrated comic rage. It's about an archetypal character who increasingly seems to stand for our national mood: the guy who's fed up and isn't going to take it anymore.
1," If you see no more than the opening shots, you will never forget them."
0," ""Who wants a life imprisoned in safety?"" Amelia asks in a voice-over. And you want to shout, ""This movie does, honey."" There's not a real or spontaneous minute in it."
1," Funny, feel-good movie has excellent messages for kids."
0," Lacks cohesion and chemistry, essential ingredients to the original's success."
0," Razor sharp editing keeps an extremely tight pace, but the wasted, non-rhythmic R-rated dialogue and an ensemble cast of morons leaves no-one to root for."
0," A queasy amalgamation of Awakenings, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Starman."
0,"You want the movie to stomp and rejoice and cry like a fool; instead it meanders and lollygags, occasionally flaring up, then sputtering again."
1," A vital, lavish, venomously profane two fingers up at Benefits Street pity porn and the social division it fosters. I laughed, winced, gagged, then laughed even more."
1, ... the protagonists of the film put ethics before ideologies and do not hesitate to confront their audience... [Full review in Spanish]
0," ... this is cinema as an immediate spectacle, pure surface. [Full review in Spanish]"
1," Even in its more banal moments, Oculus has its eye on a higher prize."
1,"A difficult film to describe without making it seem less than the masterpiece it is, 'Tokyo Story' is a remarkable work that gives a real insight into family life."
0, No one's likely to mistake this film for Harvard material.
0," Scherfig, who showed such subtlety in ""An Education,"" this time proves embarrassingly vulgar, giving the film the unfortunate aura of an angry leaflet being handed out on a street corner by a wild-eyed protester."
0," It manages, nonetheless, to shrink all narrative possibilities down into a bitty best-of compilation that's notable only for some horrendously bad science and a career-low performance from Gary Oldman."
1," A gentle film can still be searing in its effect on an audience, something that ""Monsieur Lazhar"" proves emphatically."
1," By the end, the film shows not only the power of this influence but also its terrible price in an often merciless conflict."
0,The plot's implausibilities -- and the energetic set pieces that Li and his kung-fu-fighting co-stars mount -- are mighty entertaining in and of themselves.
0, The filmmakers aren't really interested in the space between what these women say and what they mean.
1, This role fits Frank Langella to perfection as he plays away from the obvious comedy in search of greater truths.
1, It wasn't until the movie was over that I realized it had pulled off the neat trick of creeping me out without showing even a single drop of blood.
0," The Perfect Match looks and sounds increasingly like a romantic comedy created out of secondhand memories, vaguely described or poorly translated."
1," Director Mimi Leder admirably insisted on making the human relationships count for as much as the cheap thrills in this killer- comet movie. But the cheap thrills -- expensive thrills, actually -- are mostly what make Deep Impact fun to watch."
0," Even in a whiteout, you can see the plot twists coming."
0," Exorcisms, s√©ances, scurrying phantoms, slamming doors, blood rituals, possessed children, upside-down crosses - The Offering leaves few horror devices unused."
1, A story that deftly sneaks up on you before grabbing your emotions by the throat. 
1,"Exhilarating, visually astounding, thought-provoking and very, very funny."
1," As a spun-sugar, slightly screwball romantic comedy, it's a delicious 'portal' to an hour and change of escapism."
1, It is obviously the film of a master and certainly feels like a swan song.
1," An instant cult classic, one that's tailor-made for multiple viewings and bound to be popular among college students."
0," [The] actors made the choice to treat this script as award-worthy material instead of the hilarious schlock it is, and the performances are gorgeously melodramatic. "
1, Requires an expertise in Austen's works but rewards you with a decadently satisfying ending - a guilty pleasure.
1," Cast and director come together a treat in a fascinating attempt to revise the western that satisfies visually, emotionally and intellectually."
0, The saccharine-coated treatment of people struggling to learn how to forgive themselves and others takes on the ring of sentimental greetings inside a Hallmark card.
0, A mirthless comedy about venal people doing stupid things.
1," It's handsomely mounted, extremely well-acted and tells a little-known story of bravery on the part of one man daringly taking on the might of the Third Reich."
1,Gary Fleder directs this thriller with panache making the most of interlocking elements of the drama.
0," Explicitly, the film is pure fluff, a competently detailed catalog of Lennon's political ambitions told in the visual shorthand of the VH1 rock-doc."
1," Because of its gruesome subject matter, it is difficult to describe such a vile movie as being good, or even well made, but this one really is."
0," I'm beginning to believe that the minds behind The Hunger Games franchise are closer in spirit to President Snow and his sinister, heartless showmanship than to Katniss and her bravery and passion."
1, Solid summer entertainment.
0, If the viewer is expecting a mystery he will be disappointed. This is a story of a woman who has lost her husband and what her uncertainty does to her.
0, The film is too timid to offend or amuse.
1," Cheesy? A bit, but using 3-D to enhance the dance floor feels more honest than the dull 3-D of The Last Airbender."
0, an intriguing crime saga that is long on atmosphere and short on momentum
0,Are we giving mediocre movies a pass for convenience? Are we rewarding them for just not giving us any time to build up expectations that could be disappointed?
0," The first feature film from ""Funny or Die..."" director Jordan Vogt-Roberts, ""The Kings of Summer"" isn't very funny and dies slowly but surely as a coming-of-age film that bludgeons the viewer with its own quirkiness."
1," The film has already won several awards at film festivals, and once you see it, you'll understand why people are clamoring to see Colin Firth win an Academy Award."
1," Buster Keaton's final independent film is one of his finest achievements, something of a greatest hits package in its refinement of old routines."
0," So much of the movie exists for the sole purpose of driving its plot and culling some sort of emotion from the audience, that ultimately, you can feel just how empty it is."
1, ... filmmakers hit pay dirt when they got Weiner to sit for them. He's an impassioned self-deceiver who's not afraid to infiltrate enemy territory ... Now if he could only keep his namesake in his pants.
1,"There's a self-aware feel to the period pageantry, the alternatingly seductive and kinetic cinematography, and the actor's showcase this ramshackle contraption has been held together with spit and bailing wire to be."
1," To her credit, Ms. Reichardt never allows her camera to become a voyeuristic witness to a young woman in distress. Instead, it remains focused on a largely indifferent American landscape of strangers in perpetual motion to nowhere."
0," ... a myth in need of a makeover - but not this one. So little of Arthurian legend is preserved that this could be any blade swinger since Conan. No Guinevere, minimal Mordred and Merlin gets only a mention. Not a lotta Camelot."
1,"L'Auberge Espagnole"" isn't a perfect, or at times very even, film, but it's chock-full of a kind of experimentation and fun rarely found in the slick, polished and ready for the masses fare that the studios usually traffic in"
1," If you can stay awake, you'll be struck by the nuanced performances, the depth of the characterisation, the intensity of the moral questions and the drips of black humour."
1," [Achieves] level of visceral intensity that rivals the jacked-up, heart-in-mouth tension that was previously the preserve of the best fiction film-makers."
0," When audience members cheer for the ferocious killers-on-the-rampage, it really makes you wonder about our cultural values today - and society in general."
0, A jumble of kiddie slapstick and pointless chases.
1," This ""Dawn of the Dead"" inspired chiller is strong on concept, style and brutally violent action, but suffers from poor musical scoring, and a digital video format that helped keep its budget at 10 million dollars."
0, Reynolds and Jackson's cross-country bromance might have raised a smile if only writer Tom O'Connor had bothered to give their characters something remotely funny to say on the journey.
1, A style and tone as impressive as its action.
1, A film with a developed staging and that creates an interesting dialectic between reality and fiction through images. [Full review in Spanish]
1,"It doesn't want to explore epistemological questions about the nature of perception and memory; it just wants to mess with our heads. And as a wily, slightly sadistic chess game of a movie, it succeeds quite nicely."
1," Like the best ad man, he makes his point by making us laugh."
1, The stealthiest comedy since American Psycho.
1," A challenging but worth-it experience for more reasons than one can actually speak (or write) in words. It's a documentary to be watched over time, with a Carthusian level of contemplation."
1," Just because the characters are crazy, that doesn't mean they are not smart."
1, belies its low budget with both an impressive cast headed by veteran character actors and director Bob Clark's creative economy
0, [Feels] more like the pilot of episode of a short-lived CW series than a feature-length motion picture.
1, This is one of the screen's most rewarding explorations of the teacher/student relationship in any language. Every voice we hear makes sense; every opinion means something.
0," Some of what follows is amusing and even touching, but none of it fully capitalizes on the cast's star wattage."
1," Goes solely for today's oversaturation of superheroes and jabs it for all its worth. In-jokes, Easter eggs, and background details abound throughout. I highly enjoyed this film. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, etc. - also Available)"
1," Radcliffe's first post-Potter outing is plenty atmospheric, in the style of Roger Corman's Poe series. It's just not all that scary ‚Äí unless you find rattling doorknobs and dead children's faces pressed to frosty windows scary."
0," It's the content that's to blame. Signs works on a confused storyboard. What's Shyamalan trying to say anyways? Nothing, or rather a bit too much."
1," Adult horror returns to the screen with the crisp and frightening The Orphanage, a haunted-house tale about the dueling forces of childhood friendship and maternal love."
0, Saccharine piffle unredeemed by its two talented stars.
1, [T]here's... an oddly poignant attempt to redeem a hackneyed genre from pointless insensitivity.
1," Under The Sand lifts the phantom-spouse syndrome to the level of art, yet another dimension for this popular form."
0," Tears of the Sun is war fluff for the lobotomized Hollywood crowd, a transparent and thin effort without rhythm, depth, thrust or even basic structure."
1," Aside from the silly title and disappointingly pat ending, even the rom-com-averse will find something to love about Man Up."
0," You'll probably laugh, and you'll probably wish it were better."
1," If I myself find anything worth worshipping, it's the creative genius of people like M. Night Shyamalan, at whose feet I am not worthy to grovel."
0," This, my friends, is soft-core porn at its rancid worst. Shame on you, Will Ferrell and Adam McKay for producing this swill that features some of the most unlikeable characters ever put to film."
0, This movie's idea of psychology is Freudian at its most risqu√©.
1," The film is meant to be a negotiation of what that long-ago relationship was, and it is that. But in our reality of pervasive sexual iniquity, it also feels an awful lot like a litany of self-serving excuses for pedophilic behavior."
0," The film never becomes great until the final act. The rest of the film seems fake, even if it is inspired by actual events."
1,"It is entertaining and often very funny, even when you hope that director Harron will next find a subject that is truly worthy of her considerable talents."
0, I was really glad when it was over.
1," Hysterically potent, thought-provoking and deliciously nostalgic. Overall, the proposed chatter is warranted in the movingly impish Talk to Me."
0," This self-styled self-reflexive comedy asks the question, just how stupid are teenagers?"
1,"Channeling spaghetti westerns, Cervantes, Castaneda, and a dash of CHINATOWN as refracted through the visual sensibilities of Dali, it is a fiendishly clever concretion of high- and low-brow in a story that is both vision quest and farce"
0," Fanboys won't mind the absence of depth or emotion; they may even welcome it for making the film more representative of its comic-book origins. The rest of us, however, cannot rejoice at the overspending and overkill likely to come in Hellboy III."
0," As expected, all the humour involves his bumping into things and falling over because he's fat, which is apparently hilarious."
0," It's quite the emotional journey, going from peering through our fingers to derisive chuckles."
0," The movie plays like the kind of line a rich older guy would lay on a teenage model, suppressing his own intelligence and irony in order to spread out before her the wonderful world he would like to give her as a gift."
1,"Personally, it's my favorite out of the four Vacation films. Many people don't agree with me, however."
1," Great acting, sharp visuals, but edited in such a confusing way that a second viewing might be needed."
0," Cameron strives for a quirky magic realism that she can't quite pull off. The leads are all fine, and some of the photography achieves an iridescent wonder. But the film's plotting is messy and its tone uneven."
0, The biggest disappointment of the summer movie season.
0," If there were a way to switch off the dialogue, leaving the images, music and layered soundscape, Knight of Cups would be wondrous. As it is, it's a bit of an endurance test."
0," Be sure to say ""I don't"" to License to Wed"
0," Smith gives a fine lead performance, peeling away his usual affectations to expose his natural charm, but Omalu never becomes a fully developed character."
1," In Loach's hands, it has a measure of dignity and it works beautifully."
1," ... it isn't trying to be a blockbuster, and yet it out-blockbusters almost everything else this summer... "
0," If Santa Claus had a fever dream fueled by figgy pudding indigestion and an egg nog bender, his subsequent Yuletide hallucinations would probably look tame compared to Disney's aggressively opulent phantasmagoria."
1," It's not Lee's most challenging work, but it's certainly amongst his most charming."
1," ""The Great Gatsby"" not so great, but pays a decent tribute to the novel."
1," Despite the predictable body-shifting premise and a heavy dose of sentimentality, this teen comedy is extremely enjoyable"
1, Depp terrifies as dangerously violent real-life gangster.
0, [A] lazy kidnap caper.
1, This is a very accomplished movie.
0," Despite some earnest laughs and a sincere heart, Call can't seem to rise above its TV sitcom styling."
0," Peck...reduces Baldwin's in-the-moment reflections and once-daring insights to the petulance of the Black Lives Matter crusade, which overturns the principles and virtues that King, Malcolm, and Medgar represented before their deaths."
1, Bigelow crowns several decades of excellent artistic enquiry with a film that everybody should see.
0, A disastrous effort to establish the popular comic as a leading man.
0," The globetrotting adventure yarn extensively, and energetically, riffs on Indiana Jones's signature moments. You'll wish that its storytelling polish matched its enthusiasm."
1," If it can get someone who's so out of its core demographic a little verklempt, imagine what it can do for someone who's a target for such fare."
1, X-Men earns another shot at being a seminal comic-book franchise.
1," The Eyes of My Mother is effective and unsettling, and as a first movie from Pesce, promises much more in the future."
1," In one of his last films films to be released, the late Philip Seymore Hoffman gives another of his pitch-perfect performances in this twisted spy yarn set in Hamburg, Germany."
0," Stuck on auto-pilot, and therefore, comes off as a tiresome excursion into terrain that has been covered too many times to count."
1," ""Aquarius"" is a marvelous and surprising act of portraiture, a long, unhurried encounter with a single, complicated person."
1," quirky, off-beat and all around charming... has a lot of heart."
1," Genius nudges its nose, or maybe just the brim of its fedora, ahead of a lot of prestige biopics."
0, Something feels like it's missing. [Full Review in Spanish] 
0, It's an Eastwood film that very nearly strikes the same unsophisticated but delicate tone of his obligatory end-credits ditty.
1, Intense and delicately nuanced.
0," ""The Ward"" is bland shock therapy from the guy who reinvented bloody peek-a-boo with the classic ""Halloween."""
0, Despite good work done by some of the cast this post-apocalyptic cannibal tale wanders in the desert for far too long. 
1," Warm, darkly humorous, bittersweet and tender. Rolf Lassg√•rd is a revelation. "
0," Despite some legitimate signs of life, Evolution isn't fit enough to survive."
0, A big disappointment. All the pretty vistas in the world can't enliven this protracted futuro-slog.
1," That doesn't dampen the work of Richardson and Sprouse, or the romance at the film's center. ""Five Feet Apart"" works hard for its tears. But it's the honesty of the performances that makes it worth the investment."
0,"It's interesting in how very dated it has become, but all of that interest is extra-textual."
0," If you must, go for the scenery."
0," It's a headache-inducing mishmash of waving curtains, hyperactive fades, aggressive zooms, and Baz basically just throwing things at the lens (confetti, champagne, fabric, Tobey Maguire)."
0," ""The film is a saddening bore,"" David Bowie sang in ""Life on Mars,"" a tune from a far more optimistic era. It ain't quite as bad as that, but it ain't much."
0, So what is missing? A little of the original's madness and a lot of its aesthetic high-wire walking.
0," Bay seemingly relishes in tainting childhood memories, so why would this be any different?"
0, Niccol's metaphor gets silly fast.
0,"An uneasy mix of post-modern, self-referential archness and spaghetti Western bravado that's not likely to please anybody."
0, A movie with no heart or soul.
