0,Frozen II,A distressingly unnecessary (and fairly tedious) sequel...,rotten
1,Frozen II,Frozen II is the exact kind of sequel that more film series need: it takes chances (within the framework of a Disney animated feature)...,fresh
2,Frozen II,[A]n ultimately satisfying story of more mature themes for an audience that's grown out of the dress-up stage.,fresh
3,Frozen II,should be applauded for taking its own route while maintaining much of what made the original so enjoyable and memorable,fresh
4,Frozen II,"I sincerely appreciated the respect paid toward the Northuldra. The fictional Indigenous tribe based on Sámi culture. A fun and magical film, but way too many songs.",fresh
5,Frozen II,"It makes the world of Frozen feel infinite, even if the characters and the story make it feel like it's a small world after all. Perhaps I should just let it go.",rotten
6,Frozen II,"With no surprises, without looking for its female characters stand out, Frozen 2 disappoints, and misrepresents the magical sense that the first installment had. [Full review in Spanish]",rotten
7,Frozen II,"Will please fans of Anna, Elsa and her friends. [Full review in Spanish]",fresh
8,Frozen II,The whole movie is esthetically beautiful. [Full Review in Spanish],fresh
9,Frozen II,Frozen II is a notch below its predecessor but still has a lot to offer.,fresh
10,Frozen II,"The story works well enough and there is enough humor in it to go along with the more serious elements. The animation, by Walt Disney Animation studios, is beautiful.",fresh
11,Frozen II,Arguably the true stars of Frozen were the Lopez husband-and-wife songwriting team.,fresh
12,Playmobil: The Movie,"There's a plot in there somewhere, but most of the time it's subsumed by a frenetic attempt to showcase the whole Playmobil range in an extended kinetic eruption of primal sound and primary colour.",rotten
13,Playmobil: The Movie,"Playmobil: The Movie isn't as funny as some of the direct-to-video Lego-related movies, either, and that's very much the field it competes in, theatrical release or not.",rotten
14,Playmobil: The Movie,"Best watched running in the background of a playdate for pre-schoolers, buried under the noise of kids' own imaginations but offering the occasional distraction from a total toddler meltdown.",rotten
15,Playmobil: The Movie,"It does not even work as a commercial, never showing us why these toys could be especially fun to play with.",rotten
16,Playmobil: The Movie,"But much like the Playmobil toys, with their poky feet and weird, lobster-like hands, Playmobil: The Movie is similar but inferior to the Lego equivalent.",rotten
17,Playmobil: The Movie,"[F]or a movie so clearly doubling as product placement, it's also fun, a cartoon (bookended by live-action sequences) which allows talented actors to riff on unexpected themes.",fresh
18,Playmobil: The Movie,There is a gentleness and simplicity to the adventure-seeking vibe of Playmobil: The Movie that will work particularly well for very young audiences.,fresh
19,Playmobil: The Movie,A mess.,rotten
20,Playmobil: The Movie,"This is a vastly inferior toy-to-film IP expansion, with duller songs, dumber jokes, and forgettable voice work.",rotten
21,Playmobil: The Movie,"Akin to a cheap toy knockoff of toxic materials, Playmobil wields whimsy that is generic, tiresome, and probably isn't safe for young children.",rotten
22,Playmobil: The Movie,It feels like they put 1000 ideas into a bucket and picked one out each week to create the script,rotten
23,Playmobil: The Movie,"There's very little in ""Playmobil"" to suggest the film isn't just a convenient tour of the playsets you can find at your local department store toy aisle.",rotten
24,A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon,Shaun's new film is for the whole family to enjoy. [Full review in Spanish],fresh
25,A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon,"You can see the major twists and emotional beats coming from a mile away, but that's part of Farmageddon's soothing charm, too: You don't have to worry too much when things look dire, because you know it'll all turn out okay in the end.",fresh
26,A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon,"A sly, clever, and funny animated film. ... A sheer delight.",fresh
27,A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon,I was delighted throughout.,fresh
28,A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon,"The very adorable, very cute A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon is charming top to bottom, with sly sight gags and a rapturously colorful stop-motion animation style.",fresh
29,A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon,"Any money Netflix spends making movies with Aardman is welcome, and well spent.",fresh
30,A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon,"It's not as inspired as the original, but it's unbelievably sweet.",fresh
31,A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon,A novelty in the contemporary landscapes of children's movies.,fresh
32,A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon,"Shaun the Sheep is an antidote to the many babbling SpongeBobs, catchphrase-spewing anthropomorphs and singing analogs for Target-exclusive merchandise that dominate animation.",fresh
33,A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon,Unabashedly whimsical childishness carried off with such intoxicating upbeat energy that it's pure bliss to watch it with or without a child in tow.,fresh
34,A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon,It's a great film to watch as a family and everyone will laugh and enjoy the cuteness together. And of course the claymation animation is so well executed.,fresh
35,A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon,"This sequel could do with fewer recycled references to the genre it joins, but the experience is still light and frothy enough that the smile likely won't leave your face as it breezes by.",fresh
36,The Night Clerk,"For an alleged psychological thriller, The Night Clerk has no thrills, suspense or tension.",rotten
37,The Night Clerk,Forget the half-baked investigation and quarter-baked love story -- the real mystery here is how this movie is so boring.,rotten
38,The Night Clerk,"[I]t's a bit ironic that in hindsight The Night Clerk will be remembered, if at all, as a movie de Armas was way too good for-an unfortunate mile marker on her road to movie stardom.",rotten
39,The Night Clerk,"The film may intend to be a Rear Window for the mini-cam era, but it lacks Hitchockian perplexity and perversity.",rotten
40,The Night Clerk,"Those anticipating something more traditionally calibrated will likely be disappointed with the film's muted thrills and noncommittal denouement, but the elegantly composed film nevertheless makes for a creepy, contemplative entry in the Cristofer canon.",fresh
41,The Night Clerk,"The police procedural aspects of ""The Night Clerk"" are as second-rate as the detective's investigation. But the movie's more emotional quandaries compel...",fresh
42,The Night Clerk,Not only that; the film lacks rising tension - there are too many lulls in the action to keep the suspense going.,rotten
43,The Night Clerk,"Tye Sheridan, in an unusual role, plays Bart well as a tech savvy young man with Asperger's syndrome. The young actor obviously studied well and is convincing. But is this film?",rotten
44,The Night Clerk,"It's difficult, if not impossible, to imagine a more tedious, tiresome, more lifeless attempt at a neo-noir thriller.",rotten
45,The Night Clerk,Not too many discernible thrills.,rotten
46,The Night Clerk,"The Night Clerk brings on the thrills as it unravels in interesting ways. I wish the excitement could have reached a level ten, but it only goes to a seven, which, ironically, is its score.",fresh
47,The Night Clerk,"Yeah, The Night Clerk is awful.",rotten
48,Queen & Slim,"With the knock-out performances, symbolic characterization (a Martin Luther King and Malcolm X-like dynamic), and astute observations, Queen &amp; Slim is worth of the crown.",fresh
49,Queen & Slim,"Although I am grateful for the conversations on Black joy and love that this film has sparked, it flattens the experience of being Black in a time of heightened white supremacy, and in the end leads us nowhere.",rotten
50,Queen & Slim,"A remarkable debut, but it is far from being an icon. [Full review in Spanish]",fresh
51,Queen & Slim,An engrossing and polished debut film that is always pleasant and vibrant. [Full Review in Spanish],fresh
52,Queen & Slim,"It's surprising that Lena Waithe's writing is the most disappointing aspect of the film. While Kaluuya and Turner-Smith are impressive, their characters - Queen especially - remain hugely underdeveloped.",rotten
53,Queen & Slim,"For all the missteps Waithe's script seems to take, it still contains engaging, well-conceived characters (major and minor) and the narrative foundations upon which Matsoukas has built a beautiful and varied set of visuals.",fresh
54,Queen & Slim,"It is not entirely successful in its attempt to transform impotent rage into uplift, but the journey is not without its moments of visual splendour.",fresh
55,Queen & Slim,"The whole film has this dreamy, heady atmosphere, but despite all the things going on around it and all the things it's about...it is, at its heart, a love story.",rotten
56,Queen & Slim,"Set to one of the best soundtracks in years...it still resonates, though it has first-time director flaws...",fresh
57,Queen & Slim,"It will leave you speechless, there is something so tragically beautiful about the film. Heart-wrenching and also, passionately romantic.",fresh
58,Queen & Slim,"As this hot couple unwittingly become Black Lives Matter icons, the provocative script is increasingly peppered with implausible beats and infuriatingly dim decisions but it's worth riding those out to reach the transcendent moments between.",fresh
59,Queen & Slim,"Kaluuya is great, Turner-Smith even better, and while one shocking incident doesn't quite earn its place, the rest is an angry, powerful and surprisingly sexy delight.",fresh
60,Uncut Gems,It's a brilliantly exhausting movie that gaffer-tapes us to motormouth New York gem dealer and degenerate gambler Howard Ratner... The thrill and despair of the addict are palpable.,fresh
61,Uncut Gems,"Having looked at it closely, I'd say it's being over-valued. But not by much.",fresh
62,Uncut Gems,"When relief finally comes, it's heartbreaking.",fresh
63,Uncut Gems,"Uncut Gems is a fairytale written by the hand of capitalism, where mystical highs are followed by crushing blows -- and there's always a price to pay.",fresh
64,Uncut Gems,This is the year's most exciting film. You can take that to the bank.,fresh
65,Uncut Gems,"There is more to the Safdies' secret sauce than panic. At first glance the cast has the feel of a group of strangers grabbed at random from the sidewalk, yet it clicks and keeps clicking.",fresh
66,Uncut Gems,"The thing that elevates it above all else is the frenetic energy that infuses every scene, yet calibrated so perfectly so that it stays, barely, on the right side of frustrating. There's nothing more thrilling than that.",fresh
67,Uncut Gems,"Uncut Gems isn't exactly an enjoyable experience - it's stressful and hectic and anxiety-provoking. But, that doesn't take away from the fact that the Safdies have created a drama that is downright fascinating.",fresh
68,Uncut Gems,Sandler is Oscar-worthy in raw 'Uncut Gems.',fresh
69,Uncut Gems,"The Safdies have not conferred mystical powers onto their film, but like the black opal at its heart, UNCUT GEMS will transfix the viewer by reflecting something a little different back at you depending on what angle you consider it from.",fresh
70,Uncut Gems,"The Safdies create dazzling, anxiety-inducing mania that spares no moment for viewers to catch their breath... 10/10 recommend.",fresh
71,Uncut Gems,Possibly one of the most annoying movies I've seen in recent years. [Full review in Spanish],rotten
72,Premature,Premature is an extremely vulnerable portrait of a Black teen girl in love... It's also a necessary reality check for those who may have forgotten what real teen love looks like.,fresh
73,Premature,"Sure there are plenty of films about self-discovery and teenage love, but Premature is different- it's a thoughtful work that cuts right to the heart.",fresh
74,Premature,"The visual beauty of Green and Valladao's craft, best demonstrated by a knack for finding soft splashes of color to warm up gelid moments or facilitate passion, positions Premature as a mournful ode to contemporary Black identity.",fresh
75,Premature,"A warm, tender and refreshingly un-Hollywood love story. Zora Howard gives a breakthrough performance",fresh
76,Premature,"In 'Premature', Green weaves the city, the summer atmosphere, and the urgency of young love into a story that will remind you of your first love.",fresh
77,Premature,Premature begins with electricity. The only kind of electricity you can find on a crowded New York City subway in the summer - and it never goes away thanks to Zora Howard's star-making performance.,fresh
78,Premature,"Howard and Boone have great chemistry, but they're just as strong performers apart as they are together.",fresh
79,Premature,"... offers a tender and evocative examination of contemporary relationships. Like Ayanna, the film is rough around the edges before you realize it's smarter than it first appears.",fresh
80,Premature,"The way the scenes were shot felt so fresh, so real, and so full of life.",fresh
81,Premature,"This film explores the very real ways that love heals, that it transforms, that it tests and changes us.",fresh
82,Premature,"In the end, Premature was a very good effort but, like the title, it's premature.",rotten
83,Premature,"The old adage ""nothing ventured, nothing gained"" holds more than true here, both for the movie and the people within it. Yes, love hurts, but without it, what are we?",fresh
84,Top End Wedding,The tone is not permitted to become too serious and the feelgood ending is never in doubt. We can also be assured that Blair is going to harness all of the Territory's most spectacular features and show them at their most beguiling.,fresh
85,Top End Wedding,Blair's direction demonstrates significant comedic flair - there are many laugh-out-loud moments - even if the script's scruffy elements cramp his style a little.,fresh
86,Top End Wedding,"""Top End Wedding"" strains for broad farce in its tonally yo-yoing first half, before relaxing into a gentler, more poignant tale of familial bonding as the forestalled but inevitable nuptials approach.",fresh
87,Top End Wedding,The first hour of Top End Wedding can be downright annoying in its simplicity and bad screenwriting.,rotten
88,Top End Wedding,"The traditional Tiwi love song heard in the final scenes and the joyous faces of the locals - mixing trained actors with nonprofessionals - make the destination warmly satisfying, even if it's sometimes a rough ride getting there.",fresh
89,Top End Wedding,"The performances were solid, the picturesque location shots were awesome and the story had enough laugh-out-loud comedy to make it pleasing.",fresh
90,Top End Wedding,"The entire cast, no matter how minor the role, is delightful and delivers in a way the script consistently fails to do.",fresh
91,Top End Wedding,"There's a big heart here, and a fine cast to explore it, with Tapsell a completely charming screen presence, helping the material through potentially sluggish scenes of motivation.",fresh
92,Top End Wedding,"A sweet story about love in all its forms - for marriage, parenthood, heritage, and how far we're willing to go to discover ourselves.",fresh
93,Top End Wedding,The clash of cultures was an integral part of the story without it being a cheap shortcut for generic laughs,fresh
94,Top End Wedding,"There aren't many surprises, but the amusing bit players, throw-away lines and general ""feels"" that ""Top End Wedding"" leaves you with put it over.",fresh
95,Top End Wedding,Co-writers [Miranda] Tapsell and Joshua Tyler develop a heart-felt and stunning story of true love while remembering the humor that is an integral part of life.,fresh
96,By the Grace of God (Grâce à Dieu),"Mutating into a documentary-style approach, Ozon has a talented cast helping him stabilize the narrative disproportion whenever the film goes up and down in tone.",fresh
97,By the Grace of God (Grâce à Dieu),"Ozon never plays the sentimental card and while the abuse suffered by the men is no doubt horrific, the details of their inner lives remain elusive.",fresh
98,By the Grace of God (Grâce à Dieu),"There's a power to By the Grace of God that could have been less overt -- I'm looking at you, Spotlight poster in the background of one scene -- but it by and large sticks the landing.",fresh
99,By the Grace of God (Grâce à Dieu),"It treats brittle facts with visual delicacy and suggestions that, although we do not see them, are forceful, unforgettable and graceless. [Full review in Spanish]",fresh
100,By the Grace of God (Grâce à Dieu),The film is not a visual spectacle... but it is the message that possesses the true power and purpose that Ozon evidently wishes to transmit. [Full Review in Spanish],fresh
101,By the Grace of God (Grâce à Dieu),"The sensitive material of childhood abuse by the church, in a well-researched dramatization, is finely handled by French director-writer François Ozon.",fresh
102,By the Grace of God (Grâce à Dieu),"Beautifully acted and deeply impressive, By the Grace of God is suffused with a simmering anger.",fresh
103,By the Grace of God (Grâce à Dieu),The damage done in writer-director Francois Ozon's incriminating story is as sharply drawn as an assault.,fresh
104,By the Grace of God (Grâce à Dieu),The film is so good that it's hard to tell whether it's a documentary or a feature film. By the Grace of God matters - no matter what.,fresh
105,By the Grace of God (Grâce à Dieu),"The actors Melvil Poupaud, Denis Ménochet and Swann Arlaud interpret three survivors with contrasting ethical and religious positions, but also very complementary ones. [Full Review in Spanish]",fresh
106,By the Grace of God (Grâce à Dieu),"The film's pace is deliberate, made with a documentary style-no histrionics, just raw determination and mounting tension. An important, engrossing work-highly recommended.",fresh
107,By the Grace of God (Grâce à Dieu),By the Grace of God winds up being about more than child abuse. It's also about the complex group dynamics that develop when victims seek justice and about the lasting impact of one of the most severe of all imaginable betrayals.,fresh
108,The Kindness of Strangers,A syrupy brew thick with twee and an abundance of cringe-inducing moments pulling at heartstrings.,rotten
109,The Kindness of Strangers,"The movie functions like one of those star-studded Garry Marshall ensemble movies but made terribly sad until the last few minutes, when a tacked-on happy ending arrives in time for the credits.",rotten
110,The Kindness of Strangers,"[D]ear lord, I've been searching high and low for something nice to say about this mess, and I have come up nearly empty.",rotten
111,The Kindness of Strangers,"The movie, so determined to celebrate small acts of kindness among those who have least, feels a little too calculated and emphatic - a tearjerker that doesn't quite draw tears.",rotten
112,The Kindness of Strangers,"I think they've probably hit bottom with this howler, a criss-crossing ensemble piece set in New York and featuring a rogues' gallery of non-characters slowly learning to appreciate the transformative power of (sick bucket please) ""forgiveness"".",rotten
113,The Kindness of Strangers,Even Home Alone 2 is far more indelible than The Kindness of Strangers.,rotten
114,The Kindness of Strangers,The best thing about The Kindness of Strangers is that it is very much a product of our current situation when it comes to the chaotic state of the world we live in. Sometimes we get the downer movies we deserve.,fresh
115,The Kindness of Strangers,Lives interconnect in slow-paced drama with brief violence.,rotten
116,The Kindness of Strangers,"""The Kindness of Strangers"" is a mixed bag, though it's led by a wonderful performance by Zoe Kazan. In the end, she does manage to drag this film across the finish line.",fresh
117,The Kindness of Strangers,"This isn't on a par with Scherfig's best films, but the milieu and situations are immersive and the characters just colorful enough to hold our interest.",fresh
118,The Kindness of Strangers,The cast is stellar-Stella!-but everyone checks out long before it's all over.,rotten
119,The Kindness of Strangers,The inevitable indifference with which this Christmas turkey will be received should be a blessing to everyone involved.,rotten
120,System Crasher (Systemsprenger),"Zengel is a balled-up fist of energy in the title role, getting across the sweetness that can convince those who take pity on Benni that ""she's making progress,"" but unleashing hell in a flash to remind them she isn't.",fresh
121,System Crasher (Systemsprenger),"System Crasher is too intense for too long, which may tax viewers' patience. But it's difficult to shake, thanks to Zengel's utterly, admirably fearless contribution to a mindful portrait of trauma and mental illness.",fresh
122,System Crasher (Systemsprenger),A magnetic lead perfomance from the young lead but the film takes the easy way out by avoiding any sort of answers.,fresh
123,System Crasher (Systemsprenger),"A story of heartbreak bandaged up by rebellion, System Crasher will wrench your heart out of your chest and stomp all over it. As you can imagine, it's a painful experience, but one that offers just as many rewards as it does tears.",fresh
124,System Crasher (Systemsprenger),Two tenacious lead performances power this uniquely frank yet compassionate examination of angry childhood.,fresh
125,System Crasher (Systemsprenger),System Crasher is a careful and complex look at a young girl in desperate need of something that the adults in her life are unable to give her.,fresh
126,System Crasher (Systemsprenger),Systemsprenger's nuances elevate the film beyond mere misery porn and into something truly cathartic.,fresh
127,System Crasher (Systemsprenger),"While the plot lacks a conventional narrative resolution, which would be inappropriate to such a story, the conclusion attempts to bring some levity to Benni's rebellions and her carers' struggles.",fresh
128,System Crasher (Systemsprenger),[An] admirable distillation of a tough subject...,fresh
129,Goldie,Goldie is a bold expression of creativity both in front of and behind the scenes; supporting a film like this is paramount to showing the industry that art films matter.,fresh
130,Goldie,"Goldie's energy is matched by Shawn Peter's kinetic cinematography, which is paired with animation by Smith &amp; Lee, a colorful and undulating aesthetic reminiscent of Klasky-Csupo.",fresh
131,Goldie,"Goldie shows its own brand of stylistic confidence, although it's also clear that the movie doesn't exactly know what it wants to do.",rotten
132,Goldie,"Spirited main character shines in bleak, mature drama.",fresh
133,Goldie,"There's a unique vision at play, from the very first frame of the film, and I wanted to see it to its end.",fresh
134,Goldie,"Woods makes our heroine someone we warm to -- if not right away -- and more importantly, someone we won't forget.",fresh
135,Goldie,"A lively, kinetic film that dances between the natural and the fanciful, centered on a dynamo of a cinematic character played by the first-time actress.",fresh
136,Goldie,"De Jong forces us to face how few real opportunities are given to girls like Goldie, and to understand why someone would be willing to risk it all even to snatch a mere wisp of a dream.",fresh
137,Goldie,This film is filled with bursts of color. The high energy visuals counterbalance the tragic malaise of Goldie's life perfectly.,fresh
138,Goldie,"De Jong's portrait of an irrepressible New York teenager is as spirited as the central character and should find a welcome in global festivals and territories with an audience for gritty, big-hearted American independent cinema.",fresh
139,Tread,It all makes for an intriguing setup as we analyze each character and their personal versions of the truth.,fresh
140,Tread,"With a mournful compassion for everyone concerned, Solet delicately probes the fault lines ripped wide open that day by Marv and his bulldozer - whether those faults were there before, or his actions dug them.",fresh
141,Tread,"Businesses destroyed, lives shaken to their core, the cars of bystanders crushed, cops helpless to stop it - it's awful and tragic, sure. But it's something to see, man.",fresh
142,Tread,"An alarming warning sign, ""Tread"" is a tale of men who work with their calloused, grease infused hands, and despite vast differences, it's the work, the hard, dangerous, painful work that unites them.",fresh
143,Tread,"The blend of archival footage, commentary from the participants and re-enacted dramatization builds with the taut grit of a hardboiled thriller.",fresh
144,Tread,"Paul Solet's Tread takes a little while to grab the audience; however, once the stakes are fully understood, it becomes quite intense.",fresh
145,Tread,Tread is a compelling and slick documentary about this little known event... the film overall was a bit too polished with some fancy drone shots and slow motion action sequences that felt unnecessary.,fresh
146,Impossible Monsters,Ultimately Impossible Monsters is a perfectly adequate film with good production values and quite a few engaging twists and turns.,fresh
147,Impossible Monsters,"Stylish and atmospheric, but undercooked and underwhelming.",rotten
148,Impossible Monsters,"The mysterious, suggestive atmosphere primes viewers for an unexpected fantastical element.",fresh
149,Impossible Monsters,An interesting idea for this thriller-horror is frustrated by poor performances and an unintelligent script.,rotten
150,Swallow,"Writer-director Carlo Mirabella-Davis has made a feminist film that lodges deep in your throat, taking up residence in your chest as you struggle to breathe.",fresh
151,Swallow,"Neither the payoff nor the psychology behind her actions makes ""Swallow"" an illuminating enough addition to the woman-on-the-verge-of-a-nervous-breakdown genre.",rotten
152,Swallow,"There are really two contending films inside Swallow that, if given the opportunity and the space to do so, could have been fascinating as separate entities.",rotten
153,Swallow,"It's worth seeing for Mirabella-Davis' strong compositions and use of color, along with Bennett's great work.",fresh
154,Swallow,"Carlo Mirabella-Davis' feature debut would be worth recommending if it was simply an impeccably shot meditation on upper-class ennui of the Feminine Mystique variety. That being said, it's much more than that.",fresh
155,Swallow,"By the end, characters who initially seemed so simple have taken on startlingly different personas, revealing the true face of an oppressive system in the process - one in which men make the rules, and can institutionalize those who don't conform.",fresh
156,Swallow,"[Bennett's] incredibly skilled, impressively controlled and subtly powerful performance papers over some of the cracks here, while the styling and candy-bright color pops ensure Swallow goes down smoothly, even in its tougher moments.",fresh
157,Swallow,[T]he disgust and uneasiness ... overshadow our ability to sympathize with the character...,rotten
158,Swallow,"Despite the bizarre premise, Swallow is one of the most intriguing watches of 2020. It's worth a look. It may be an acquired tasted for some, but it will be a treat for others.",fresh
159,Swallow,"Swallow doesn't always go down smoothly but it does expose how marriage can be a trap, family skeletons continue to rattle and freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.",fresh
160,Swallow,[Bennett] perfectly embodies the zombie-like motions that result from existing in this purgatorial limbo [and] the naked suffering underneath.,fresh
161,Swallow,"As the emotional anchor for the film, Bennett gives a revelatory performance in Swallow, one comprised of grace, a stoic sense of determination, and a quiet sense of longing to fit in.",fresh
162,"Standing Up, Falling Down","Chemistry between the leads is key. Schwartz comfortably holds his own against the evergreen Crystal, twinkle still firmly in his eye.",fresh

174,After We Leave,"I was blown away by how good After We Leave looks, its subtlety and plausibility and confident simplicity.",fresh
175,After We Leave,"Once in a while, a budget indie film comes along that makes us glad this art form is still around. After We Leave is a shining example of indie filmmaking at its finest.",fresh
176,After We Leave,"Although it does get a little bumpy along the way, Aleem Hossain's feature film debut remains a promising genre entry.",fresh
178,After We Leave,"His ultimate dilemma... is deftly handled and moving, ensuring that Hossain's 'one last job' scenario, for all its futurist gizmos (temple phones, paralytic implants, etc), stays down to earth.",fresh
179,Black Christmas,"The choice to go PG-13 on the gore and thrill level for this reboot makes it feel more like a TV movie than a feature film. Still, it was probably the right choice for the intended audience.",rotten
180,Black Christmas,"Despite its desperate efforts to justify the homicides, there's nothing remotely innovative or even goofily satirical about it.",rotten
181,Black Christmas,"At its best, ""Black Christmas"" is a smart alternative to slasher horror, and Takal provides a needed voice in the current conversation. Her message is clear, but her execution needs some work.",rotten
182,Black Christmas,"It has plenty of ideas, but falls short in delivering the scares.",rotten
183,Black Christmas,Takal and Wolfe distinguish their film with an in-your-face fury aimed at contemporary campus culture's negligent approach to sexual assault and the ways in which women are forced to deal in its aftermath.,fresh
184,Black Christmas,"Fans of the original ... might not love writer-director Sophia Takal's take, but Black Christmas is a fun film that gets its kicks out of literally smashing the patriarchy.",fresh
185,Black Christmas,"Black Christmas ends up being a lump of coal with its poor screenplay and weak character development, even if it has some fun moments.",rotten
186,Black Christmas,Wrong-headed is an understatement in this new approach to the material and we are taken for a third act ride that is equal parts baffling and preposterous.,rotten
187,Black Christmas,"We need more feminist genre cinema, but that doesn't mean we have to accept half-baked films like this.",rotten
188,Black Christmas,"I love the mass murder of a bunch of rapist Kavanaughs as much as anyone, believe me, though I'm not sure the catharsis it proffers is anything but temporary--or, worse, merely palliative.",rotten
