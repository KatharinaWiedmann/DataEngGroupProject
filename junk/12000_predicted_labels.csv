311169," Orson Welles devotes 9,000 feet of film to a spoiled brat who grows up as a spoiled, spiteful young man. This film hasn't a single moment of contrast; it piles on and on a tale of woe, but without once striking at least a true chord of sentimentality.",1

1574,"Watching this film is like being slapped in the face, which is surely [Adewale] Akinnuoye-Agbaje's intention. What he went through is appalling from any angle. This is a big story, and it's well told, but there's a lot more to it.",1
3289,Offers a satisfying sequence of slasher slays but the film relies so much on cognitive disconnect that it never feels like more than an ironic kill count.,1

42834,"A build-up of secrecy and anxiety are well-served by Van Sant's chopped-up narrative of the slow reveal, and again the director shows a keen eye for the rituals and worries of teenage life.",0
2495,"Despite my inability to understand some of the dialog , and the fact that I'm not a fan of this kind of music, I enjoyed the film. It is well written and acted. Director Tom Harper also helmed another of my favorite 2019 films, 'The Aeronauts.'",1
45520,Intriguing character study and exciting war drama rolled into one,1
1979,"Except for the enjoyable nostalgia that swells in the form of throwback cameos, Vince Gilligan probably should've left this one alone. This movie may have sounded good in theory, but turns out it's far more story than anybody needed or wanted.",1
14914,"Thirty years later, there are still rumblings of making another sequel, but no one would dare suggest a reboot or re-imagining; Ghostbusters is perfect exactly as it is.",1

22982,This movie is so damn predictable.,1

41958,... Adds up to far more than the formula typically allows.,1
49213,"The film's familiarity is pleasant enough, and screenwriters Sarah Williams and Kevin Hood flaunt a strong working knowledge of Austen's work, peppering the movie with what amounts to inside jokes for readers familiar with the writer's six novels.",1

272035," Mean Girls is the dork giving up its uniqueness and disguising its intelligence in the quest to be utterly, tragically ordinary--and that's like so ironic or something.",1
33641, The worst-directed action film since Guillermo del Toro's Pacific Rim...yet another serving of action mulch where you simply do not care where the bullets land. (Sigh. Where's Steven Seagal when you need him?),0
366,"The big question you can't help but asking after watching Zombieland 2 is was this film really necessary? About 10 years ago, this film would have been a no-brainer, but now it feels a bit more like a nostalgia exercise.",1

260921, All the pieces of the movie slide mechanically into place and wait - and wait - for some spark of soul to turn up and animate them.,0
58150," The movie starts with some ugly material, but ends up introducing audiences to a beautiful place, making this tale of the white oppression of the Black body much more than a gratuitous demonstration.",1
5885,Brrrrrrrrrrrr... definitely the scariest movie that I've seen so far this year.,1
263441, It's the movie's wobbly tone and its betrayal of its characters in the name of niceness that dooms The Break-Up into being a film that will satisfy no one -- not even the bottom-line thinkers.,1
436048," This Coens-lite comedy squeezes every last drop of craziness from its source but is undone by a thin third act. McGregor's a good straight man, but it's Clooney's show.",0
5697,"Neither the payoff nor the psychology behind her actions makes ""Swallow"" an illuminating enough addition to the woman-on-the-verge-of-a-nervous-breakdown genre.",1
5246,"The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience is a dizzying mix of music and visuals that balances itself perfectly between overt ridiculousness, telling a bittersweet story, and respect for the craft.",1

788,"Gorgeously shot, art directed and costumed, the visuals were strong but the storytelling was not clear. Filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola has released a 139-minute director's cut, and his revisions finally do justice to the script.",1

2972,Ignore the film's marketing materials. This thriller has more to offer than empty calorie scares.,1
38923," Failing to work on so many levels, The Informers operates as a time capsule of 1983 and a time when substance was negated in favour of style. Sadly, this movie is severely lacking in both of those departments.",0
20232,"Angelina Jolie gives a mixed-bagged performance. Sometimes she is annoying, affected and just plain selfish...other times she endearing and funny",1

34104,"Obvious, irritating boxing girl power movie.",1

1728,"The Gallows Act II is a disaster on almost all levels. Its script is jumbled and clichéd, has an abundance of jumpscares, and has a maddening ending that makes the rest of the film seem pointless.",0
2829,"Kramer crafts an aura of unnerving apocalyptic certitude that grows in power as events progress, the final scene a breathlessly haunting coda that sent chills racing up and down my spine.",1

319969," 'We are one' may have seemed like a twee message in the hands of a lesser artist, but Kossakovsky handles it with grace and intelligence.",1
396217," It really never deserved to be more than a quickie TV-movie on the WB, where it would've aired around Halloween and then faded into oblivion.",1
8413,"Feeble as comedy, the movie is needlessly violent, too, as if half the crew misguidedly thought they were making a foul-mouthed action thriller.",1
1768,Another remake that is made at the Disney level of craft but at the cost of originality and soul.,1
19828,"Because of its sometimes murky plot and lethargic pace, the film never delivers a real knockout punch as a thriller. It's more like a semi-thriller, at best, steeped in atmosphere but lacking in scary moments.",1
110703, The most disappointing of the original three episodes but still charming and thrilling.,1
101760," It's an interesting meta-textual experiment, but that doesn't in itself make for an interesting movie, or a suspenseful one. There are things to like about it, but the whole doesn't really seem equal to the sum of its parts.",1
201169," Gory shark tale has violence, profanity. ",1
4790,"It's all pretty conspicuously average, but The Kid comes to life in its second half, when Hawke takes center stage. Unsurprisingly, he's the best thing in the movie by a country mile.",1
62821," It's cheesy and implausible. Despite the filmmaker's best efforts, the essence of J.D. Salinger remains elusive.",1
375692," It's Stan Lee by way of Cormac McCarthy, but the end result -- basically, No Country for Old X-Men -- suffers from its own sense of self-importance.",1

180054," [An] absorbingly sadistic psychological whodunnit. Fixating in its gripping hold, Zodiac is convincingly haunting in its head-scratching mode.",1
52455, Burnett's acute and sensitive direction is free of hackneyed movie conventions; even something as simple as a hello is said differently from the way you've heard it in any other movie.,1
370282," Red 11 isn't revolutionary, but it's a manic, surreal journey into the creative process of Robert Rodriguez that serves as a nice allegory to the director's own observations on filmmaking.",1
28792,"While some parents might wish the film had more emotional depth, they will probably appreciate the gentle humor. Then they can introduce their children to the book.",1
12305,A shattering piece of filmmaking that successfully ties the suspense of a real-time crime with the tragedy of a larger social ill. It will make you feel something. ,1
346625, The film is an incoherent mess that may prove baffling to those unfamiliar with the source.,0
