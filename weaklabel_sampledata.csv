0, Parental Content Review
1, Director Wayne Wang proves with Maid in Manhattan that even predictable movies can leave you feeling warm and fuzzy.
0, the lack of dramatic development doesn't leave much for the actors to work with
1, A riveting documentary that explains education and the violent changes that are rocking Pakistan.
0," The problem with The Informant!, aside from that overcoaxing exclamation mark, is that it's not especially funny."
0, Too tepid and too predictable of a picture to simply sail away into the sunset.
0, Bernie lacks the edge of malice one might reasonably expect from so nasty a tale.
0, Simply one of the poorest entertainments ever offered up to the world's children.
0," More drab ""fi"" than dreamy ""sci."""
1," With its emphasis on nature and its mudbound farmers, this beautifully crafted film recalls other earthly European historical dramas set in an isolated countryside."
1," It's not like having a real film of Nijinsky, but at least it's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered."
1,"The intelligently observed and staggeringly beautiful Italian foreign-language Oscar nominee is about life, death and the search for the things that give meaning to both."
0, Yields at least two spectacular scenes... The rest is a little more uneven. 
0," The 'Mr. Holland's Opus' meets 'Rocky II' story will satisfy some who long for innocuous content, even those who know James deserves better material."
0," The Lawnmower Man, Max Headroom and Johnny Depp walk into a bar. They get drunk and decide to make a movie."
1, The Cell's striking visuals along with its fantastical costumes absolutely mesmerize the viewers.
0, Director Takashi Miike's dish of sukiyaki spaghetti ala Sergio Corbucci is badly seasoned with scraps of reservoir dogs.
1, [House of Wax] gleefully trots out all the clichés of the genre before going out in a blaze of glory with a truly spectacular final act.
1, treats the audience with respect without being overly pretentious
1,"This movie's calm, steady control keeps a wide variety of good actors in the same universe."
1," As usual with Pixar, the film looks like a moving work of digital art, though its inordinate length might test the patience of six year olds who will love the brilliantly staged action but not all the exposition-heavy dialogue."
0," Soon blands out into the glib, ethnicky slapstick that is the regrettable stock in trade of Nia Vardolos."
1, The story is incredible.
0, It's one of those movies which are so desperate to become cult viewing that they feel no obligation to be any good.
1," It's virtually all Hemsworth's show and he's entirely up to the task of carrying the film on his broad shoulders: He's charismatic, fearless, confident, jokey and a good old Kentucky boy who just wants to get the job done ..."
1," An exhaustive, ruminative, angry and even occasionally gallows-humorous account of the strange domino effect of tragedy compounding incompetence compounding tragedy that dealt a critical blow to one of America's great cities."
0, The final segment is as cliched and as predictable as any of the many films that have chronicled the rise and fall of well-known musical figures.
0, It is a bland attempt of supernatural horror that becomes more and more embarrassing in every imaginable aspect. [Full review in Spanish]
0, Avoid at all costs.
0," Ultimately, it dashes into so many close-ups of carnage and neckbreaking, it skids scuzzily close to spy-snuff. Call this Bourne-porn; Safe House needed a safe word."
1," An intense mix of horror, thriller and domestic drama, this is exquisite filmmaking."
0, Gorgeously animated children's film about the mythical guardians of childhood just misses being magical.
1," It takes all of 10 minutes for Doremus' film to reveal itself to us: this is a movie about a conflicted father who has arrived at a crossroads, both morally and artistically."
0,"Despite the estimable talent on hand both behind and in front of the camera, the story never comes to convincing life and doesn't, in the end, have anywhere particularly surprising or interesting to go."
0," Mostly serves as an overwrought ""woe-is-me"" tale about a director in over her head."
0," Writer-director David Lowery strains for poetry at every turn, and only the strain registers."
0, This is a movie about how watching movies is stupid.
0," I certainly wouldn't go so far as to call it a bad movie, it's just a movie that could have used a little improvement in the story department."
1, An utterly amazing and riveting start to a brand new beginning...
0," [A Cure For Wellness] doesn't just stretch the limits of plausibility, it punches plausibility in the guts, pushes it into a river and waves goodbye."
0," Amirpour gives us little reason to care (apart from Miami Man's nice portraits of his daughter, maybe) and so, instead, I wondered: What if a person tried not to do terrible things?"
0," Stallone plopping Statham in this bore feels like an alpha setting up his successor to fail, like Zeus swallowing up his challengers before they force him into retirement."
0," Inorganic and implausible, this Bollywood-inflected rom-com features little comedy and even less romance."
0, All the people of Chuck & Buck feel very human.
0, Suffers from bouts of listlessness and lackluster writing.
0," Too bad, though, that The Crucible fails to probe deeper into the sexual, religious, and political conditions that can give false accusations so much power -- even today."
1," Though ""Thor: Ragnarok"" may feel like a lightweight entertainment, it comes packed with the same ingredients that made Whedon's ""The Avengers"" so good."
0," For those with a burning curiosity to know how The Lord of the Rings as directed by Michael Bay might look, Wrath of the Titans provides an idea."
1," A superb, impassioned concert film."
1," Though Nixey carries it across with some style, some intensity, and some graphic imagination, the whole isn't quite the sum of its somes."
0,"There are some funny and charming lines, but the film is overlong and it rambles a bit."
0,It fumbles a bit by prioritizing the goofy antics of its white cast over what turns out to be a smart depiction of non-Western life.
0," ufus Sewell and Rupert Graves do add some thespian punch as the intrepid video director and the pampered producer, but it's not nearly enough to keep this one from extremely bombing."
0, The film is strictly by-the-numbers slasher boilerplate. It won't endure past the weekend.
0," We're told what we already know and ultimately, the film's two lead characters remain its most elusive ..."
0," Unnecessarily gloomy and emotionally convoluted, Spike Jonze and Dave Eggers' script for Where the Wild Things Are is a melancholy adaptation of the one-two punch that is the heavily illustrated, scantly written book by Maurice Sendak. "
1, A narrative shapeshifter that gleefully toys with its audience's perception of love and themselves.
0," Rather than reasoned thought and debate, the only thing this movie inspires is exasperation."
1," A quick, efficient thriller that gets right to the point."
0," 'God is punishing me,' says the matriarch. Not just you."
1," Greene has made a hard movie to argue with, even as he invites you to do exactly that."
1," Star Chris Pratt says it best, 'It's adventure, it's romance, it's a thriller, it's scary, but it's emotionally resonant.' Amen. Once you accept the premise, with good acting and special effects, this is a terrific way to spend two hours."
0," It is as if The Sunlit Night aims to be unconventional merely for the sake of it. It has all of the dressings of a lovable indie, complete with the unusual setting and affable feel, but ultimately, it's structured in a way that fails to due it justice."
1," I like the idea of this, I like the look of this...It's kind of superficial, and I don't know [if] there's a whole lot of depth to whatever allegory this is intended to be. It's just an exercise in style, and that's cool. "
0, Rent Drop Dead Gorgeous if you want to see how a funny movie on the beauty pageant world is done! This is all formula.
1," Imagination is the real star of Sendak's classic and Jonze and his co-writer, Dave Eggers, have expanded on its brief text to spin a story in which the tough and the tender smoothly coalesce."
0," Given all the name-brand products invoked, their misadventure suggests a sort of nightmarish shopping spree."
1,Gallo's combination of crudeness and sophistication has a preternatural power.
1, This chick-lit flick is an 'English Patient' style epic.
0," Despite its continual profanity and sexual references, it isn't particularly offensive, just mostly forgettable."
1," [MacGruber is] a film that's easy to watch and consistently funny, even if it is as substantial as a merengue."
0," Almost nothing happens for long stretches before a plot ""twist"" so obvious that only the dull-witted could fail to see it coming."
0," By trying to recapture the magic of the original, Neighbors 2 has disproved the existence of magic."
0," Farhadi's films are suffused with an oppressive atmosphere, and there is something increasingly formulaic in his storytelling."
0," If forced to choose, skip Night School -- a remedial-level comedy with Kevin Hart [and Tiffany Haddish]."
1," Romantic comedies are a staple of popular cinema and I Love You, Man follows a familiar trajectory, but in a refreshingly different way."
0," Wild Target neatly and boringly makes a surrogate family out of its ill-matched trio of caricatures, and its epilogue of domesticity is enough to make you reach for your revolver."
0," Two directors and six writers, and all they had to do was find an excuse for the kind of party scene that happens only in lame-brained movies like this. Is this the best they could come up with, really?"
1, Co-writer and director Billy O'Brien does a masterful job of building up the creep factor but gets too ambitious in the second half of the story.
1," A fascinating and intoxicating tale of cannibalism that examines the savage sexual awakening of a shy adolescent, whose complex psychology and inner struggle are described with great delicacy. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0, There's nothing remotely redeeming about this film. Watch this at your own risk.
0," ...unfortunately for Marfa Girl 2, physicality is favoured over soul and [Clark's] characters continue to not care about their lives, so why should we either?"
1, Subjects that would seem like rom-com contrivance in lesser movies are sturdy and thoughtful here. It's a well-filled romance.
0, The film just glumly proceeds.
1," The story's time-travel elements never quite make sense, but subtle performances and directing give this film an unexpected edge."
0," To his credit, Langenegger keeps things relatively simple instead of resorting to lots of fast cutting and fancy camera angles. To his detriment, the picture he has made barely moves at all."
0," Kids have seen much better animation in other films, and it's hard to imagine too many grown-ups ready to smile and nod at yet more smirking takes on famous moments from Scarface and The Silence Of The Lambs."
1," Consistently warm, and in moments savvy and irreverent, this feminist day trip of Asian immigrants to a British searesort contains some lurid and funny fantasies staged in the colorful Bollywood style."
1, The Gospel According to André is the most essential fashion documentary since Bill Cunningham New York in 2010.
1," B.B. King. Bill Withers. Miriam Makeba. Celia Cruz. And James Brown, earning every inch of the title, ""Godfather of Soul,"" who all by himself probably deforested a few acres around Kinshasa with the volcanic blast of his set."
1," It illogically breezes by, even if much of the story shows our heroes doing little but hiding, fighting, and strategizing. "
1," Sure, we can nitpick things like Joe Colton not having a beard, or Roadblock not talking in rhyme, but the spirit of the property many of us loved in one form or another is there."
1," There are some great, brilliant action scenes, but this is more thoughtful and darker and more in the vein of Batman Begins. And that's a very good thing."
0," The loudest laughs in this ""serious comedy"" came from three brief appearances by author Salman Rushdie as a doctor."
1," A solid-enough L.A. noir whose hook, and albatross, is the transformation of a beautiful Oscar-winning actress into a desiccated crone."
1,"Neither revolutionary in its approach or subject matter nor seamless in its storytelling, Billy Elliot nevertheless manages to sketch the lives of characters we come to care about."
0," The whole thing is a big mess, but sometimes it is an amusing mess -- and doubly so once Cage shows up. Bless his heart."
0," Affleck has talent behind the camera, so much I can't wait to see what he's got up his sleeve next, but even with that being so his latest cinematic heist is in the end one I didn't want to remain a part of."
0, Ewan McGregor's inert adaption smooths out the Philip Roth novel's eruptions of self-loathing and doubt. 
1," God Help the Girl is a smart, powerful little flick. Sometimes I hated it. But I won't forget it."
0," Perhaps ""perversely watchable"" might be the right term to describe the film."
1," Blue Jasmine captures a manic and delusional woman attempting to rebuild herself after a prodigal life she received, but never deserved."
1," It's clear that this portrait of a sick society is meant to explain, at least partially, the horrendous war that breaks out at the very end of the film, and the fascism that quickly followed in its wake."
0," If not entirely a downer, this is no topper."
1,"Confident, uncompromising and blisteringly realistic, Sweet Sixteen is a gritty and immediate film yet it goes right to the emotions."
1," Torres's...writing is blunt and evocative, like poetry turned prose. The new film adaptation of the book by director Jeremiah Zagar turns the story back into poetry again."
1," Storytelling in its purest form: it works as a no-fat thriller, yet it achieves nuanced character dimension and thematic complexity"
0, Shana Feste's pot-slinging cross-country road-trip dramedy deals in paternal disappointment and familial reconciliation but remains a bit high on its own supply.
1," People cynically walk into so much expecting disappointment - auditoriums showing Woody Allen's annual crapshoot, for example. Sometimes, they get expected middling results. Sometimes, as with Allen's 30-year-old script, they get unanticipated surprises."
1, A meticulously researched and ably handled chronicle of one of the largest corporate scandals in American history.
1, Michael Douglas with his giant crazy man stare and beard to match is quite funny.
1," Despite a nagging sensation about its shortcomings, the acting and the atmospherics continue to haunt me."
0," It telegraphs its ineptness at the outset with saccharine ""slice of life"" dialogue. With little chemistry between Witherspoon and Ruffalo it dismally failed the watch test."
0, The filmmakers aren't really interested in the space between what these women say and what they mean.
1, It's clear that Mbatha-Raw is a precocious talent.
0," It's better than The Bounty Hunter, with the two leads making a more charming couple than Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler, but it's still difficult to view Killers as anything more than throwaway fluff."
1, The two leads manage to carry the day through sheer gumption.
0, There's no heart to be found amid the guts.
1," Its initial enigma seems to need no explanation; yet, once deciphered, the film does not falter but moves only deeper into the emotional territory it charts."
0," The shortcuts are maddening, but so is Spread as a whole. Just because the lead character is an insipid, mean-spirited waste of time doesn't mean the movie has to follow suit."
0," Easy, quick and utterly forgettable."
1, The rampaging reptile is back to remind us that monsters have meaning.
1," Marjorie Prime is ultimately more about its ideas than its characters, but that's OK, because they're fascinating ideas. "
0," ... a shaggy-dog version of a Jack London story, enhanced with an animatronic leopard seal that looks like Charlie the Tuna."
1, It's so much fun that it's easy to overlook the film's rather conventional plot arc.
0," Here's that J. Edgar Hoover biopic you asked for, or at least something that meets all the technical requirements to be considered one."
1," It's nice to see the always compelling Hawke - here, tenser and more laconic than ever - in a role where his face's deep stress lines come into their own."
0, Even Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli wizardry can't ward off this story's jinxes.
1," This is a delightful movie, funny, absurd, anarchic and profound. "
1," One would have to invoke supernatural influences to make it believable, and that is pretty much what is being invoked."
0,"There is a moment in ""The Tourist"" when Johnny Depp turns to Angelina Jolie and asks ""Why is all this happening?"" It's a question moviegoers will be asking themselves as well."
0," Borrowing (or repackaging) liberally from 20th century musical titans, La La Land often appears drunk on nostalgia... It's a traditionalist that so longs to be a revolutionary, but not really. "
0," Someday, when Mirren receives a lifetime achievement award, there will be a montage of her performances in great films. Winchester will not be a part of that montage."
1, A work of battered brilliance.
0, Inoffensively bland.
0," Alas, with the notable exception of the empathetic Boutella, the cast of Climax consists primarily of dancers who are not actors."
1," Mockingjay Part 2 is a fittingly dark end to the Hunger Games franchise, not as exciting perhaps as Catching Fire, but more politically charged."
1," As with fights, we understand at all times what we're seeing; Surprises aren't the result of whim or betrayal to the logic of the story. [Full review in Spanish]"
1,"Not only does the film effortlessly mock the sense of wonder and the emotional roller-coasters we've all felt watching Pixar's big-eyed sentient objects, but, in its own messed-up way, it provokes some new feelings, too: shock and awe ..."
0," Tusk, based on one of Kevin Smith's Smodcasts, smakes a strong case for a smintervention. "
1," No, it's no Fargo. It's the most flamboyant, erratic, spontaneous movie the Coens have ever made."
0," The filmic equivalent of a roofie: you're sure that something happened while you were out, but damned if you know what it was."
1," The movie is quite derivative, transplanting the familiar tropes of the fantasy genre onto owls. Still, I liked it well enough to endorse it for smaller children."
1,"... pay your money and take the ride,... laugh and ... be strangely moved by the odd-looking creatures Russell has assembled for his latest ensemble play."
0," For all its visual delights, Magic in the Moonlight, the 44th feature written and directed by the admirably industrious Woody Allen, has to be one of his bigger duds."
0," Once you get beyond nostalgia for dodging red balls whipped at your head, there's little here."
0," The scenery is spectacular and the food porn is fabulous, but what should be insouciant feels insipid in this stretched-out travelogue, mostly due to underwritten characters and awkward performances."
0, There's nothing much here for those outside the PG Disney Princess-aimed target market to sink their horns into.
0, It would be difficult to imagine material more wrong for Spade than Lost & Found.
1," Another exceptional piece of propaganda, designed to get you riled up, but also to get you to laugh."
0," The acting is pretty good, and the characters are interesting, but the screenplay lacks the imagination it takes to elevate this story above the ordinary, predictable level of a common ghost story. It doesn't help this was also done on the cheap."
0, A self-indulgent romp through standard Neapolitan stereotypes.
1," ...while it doesn't achieve the brilliance of the modern Batman franchise, and while it certainly has a few flaws... the action is undeniably well-done and there are still good character bits throughout."
1," I was afraid this was going to be another case where a greedy studio doing a book adaptation managed to screw things up by splitting a book in half, ending up with a movie with half a story, but this one works out O.K."
0," I didn't think it was possible to make a boring action film in New Orleans, but Bullet to the Head proved me wrong."
0," With its undertones of slavery and cockfighting, Pokémon"" may have the most unsavory premise ever for children's entertainment."
1," The film gets long in the tooth and it's ambition to be both dirty and touching spreads a solid story a little thin...but ""Trainwreck"" has so much in it to like, not the least of which is the future potential of more Amy Schumer/Judd Apatow collaborations."
0," Hide and Seek is a technically slicker paranoid thriller than director John Polson's previous Swimfan, but its esteemed posture makes it even trashier."
1," It's rare for a film about a Mexican drug cartel and the impossibility of the American Dream to be either disarming or funny, but Clint Eastwood has blessedly delivered one that is consistently both."
1, It's an example of a clever actress taking control of her career.
1, The film delivers laughs and heart and some strong ideas and energy...
1," An attractive and robust screen adaptation of the classic 1861 Dickens parable of false hopes, thwarted vanities and the mysterious workings of sowing and reaping."
0, Maybe something this surreal needs unknowns to keep it in the ether.
0," A midnight movie for those fine with dozing off about twenty minutes in, once the charm of its single sentence log-line has worn off."
0, Even the publicity geeks can't convincingly milk as exhausted a teat as X-Men.
0, Those who buy into the peculiar superstition that only the even-numbered Star Trek movies are any good will find their belief system strongly challenged by Star Trek: Nemesis.
1," ...a perfectly tuned sense of character nuance [that] holds you more spellbound than 90 percent of Hollywood's ""crowd-pleasers."""
1," Rugrats again blends poignancy with fun in a way that touches parents, even as it goes for kids with a run of bodily function and booger jokes."
0," If anything, the release of ""The Predator"" is a great excuse to re-watch the original."
1," The Adventures of Tintin can be a delight to look at, even if motion capture isn't your particular cup of animation tea."
1," Fusing the personal and the political, Bouchareb's stirring war drama comes with a modern-day resonance and plenty of punch. Recommended."
1," Vicky Cristina Barcelona, which Allen wrote and directed but did not act in, is Woody at the top of his game."
1," Combining, as Meyers films do, pleasant fantasy with aspirational settings. I know I'll watch it again when it comes on cable, or if I have the flu or need to fold laundry."
1," An epic, evocative of another epoch and of landscapes beyond time."
0," Walking out of the movie I was mostly disappointed, since I felt that there was something there that could've been great, but instead was ho-hum."
1," A bombastic three-hour saga that moves like a 1,000-page book left idle in front of a window fan."
1," The film never stops moving, and it's always a pleasure to watch."
1,"The ultimate destination creates the opportunity for Penn to draw up a summation for his protagonist's journey, and it's a moral that should satisfy those viewers looking for meaning and order."
1," Before taking a dark swerve into chilling verité at the close, BlacKkKlansman ... kicks up suggestions of the pilot for a great 1970s mismatched cop show. It's that funky."
0," An emotionally empty, thematically ill-defined, and listless affair. It is never able to communicate the complexity of the woman at its center."
0," A shoddy and indulgent mass of bits from other movies with a shapeless, shameless performance by British comedic actor Steve Coogan as its unfixed center."
1," The film teases us with a paradox: arguably Nim's keepers were wrong to try to endow their protege with human attributes, but can we empathise with his suffering without making the same mistake?"
0," Jamais consegue oferecer qualquer tipo de resposta para perguntas obviamente importantes em uma biografia como esta, a começar pela mais relevante: quem era este homem?"
1," If you watched all of the ""Mission: Impossible"" films in a row, starting with 1996's original, would they feel like a James Bond version of ""Boyhood""? Maybe."
1," Jordan Peele has made something scathing, hilarious, and -- as unlikely as this may sound -- totally fresh. I am pleased -- who am I kidding? I'm f----g thrilled -- to announce that Get Out is a legitimately great movie."
1, A warm and moving sleeper hit.
1, It's a powerful drama that works on a couple of levels.
1," It's a great subject, with great objects of fascination, study, interpretation."
0, What still eludes Burton is the ability to deepen the superficial allure of his visions.
0," A strong supporting cast also does good work, and the film -- as is the case of all Egoyan's films -- is made with smooth professionalism. It's a pity that it increasingly strays into the direction of almost laughable improbability."
0," Youngsters will no doubt flock to see it, which is a good thing, only if it keeps them out of traffic."
1," An action thriller that, while flawed, still reminds us that, if he really wanted to, The Rock could still become the next Schwarzenegger."
1," The specter of [John] Hughes is all over this entertaining, clever, and finally heartwarming comedy."
1," In these linked vignettes, Another Year paints an empathetic portrait of working-class contentment and anxiety."
1," First and foremost...the reason to go see ""Blue Crush"" is the phenomenal, water-born cinematography by David Hennings."
0," [Christopher] Doyle remains a distinctive cinematographer, even if his directing here is ultimately disappointing."
0, The dialogue is so bad it's kind of terrific; the movie has a particular camp appeal that may well win it a cult following.
1," At its best, Tropic Thunder skewers impotent directors, fascist producers, prima donna stars and classic scenes from the camo-fatigues genre."
1," A meticulously shot and sharply written character study, it plays like a blend of the Coen brothers and Quentin Tarantino."
1," The acting is very convincing by Hoss and Zehrfeld. Writer-Director Christian Petzold (""Barbara"") has crafted a compelling ghost story about a woman, thought to be dead, who gets a chance to see what people really thought about her."
0, A dark and often unattractive movie.
0,Its supposedly innovative epic style looks decidedly old-fashioned here.
0," In the Heart of the Sea is neither history nor myth but a hokey, unworkable Hollywood mix of the two."
1," Exciting, provocative genre cinema."
1," The humor is spot on, and the film drew some genuine laughs from me, especially the scene with Richie and the cricket bat."
1," The sins of fathers, sons and lovers come pouring onto the audience in a torrent of stifling intensity."
0, Why do so many horror movies that begin with promise fall apart in the final act?
0," It's a deeply unpleasant picture, all the more offensive for its veneer of comedy, stretched ever-more thinly over a carnival of brutality."
1," Endhiran -- The Robot provides maximum bang for its reported $34 million budget with a sensationally overstated and overwhelming mash-up of American-style, f/x-driven sci-fi spectacle and exuberant Bollywood-style songs, dance and romance."
1," A perfectly enjoyable exercise in superheroics, and much more fun to watch than 'Man of Steel'."
0," Other than a few droll period references and a handsomely evoked, quaintly drab early 1960s Paris, there's little else to distinguish this heavy-handed romantic comedy."
1,Delivers the goods as a zippy piece of sci-fi pulp.
1," A sometimes scathing, sometimes goodnatured satire of the French film industry."
1," ""The Exception"" is a diverting and occasionally exciting film, though it is rarely disturbing or thought-provoking in ways the material might require."
1," Elliot's record of an unconventional friendship revels in grotesque detail and scatological humour, but yields unexpected depth and poignancy."
0, Stick with Twister.
0, Why is goodhearted liberal cinema sometimes so dumb?
1, A gift of a documentary.
0," A fitful, effects-driven and remarkably unambitious summer release about a midget jewel thief masquerading as a baby."
0," McPherson's good actors remind you how stage plays generate interest solely through talk and, as The Eclipse gets further away from cinema, a bigger mystery develops: Why is McPherson's filmmaking so uncinematic?"
1, [An] affecting study of independence and friendship.
1," As one might expect from a zombie romance, the film doesn't pack a lot of big ideas. Still, the concept is original, and watching it unfold is loads of fun."
0," Unless you're a 15-year-old boy who thinks motorcycle racing on dirt tracks is the 'next big thing,' you may ignore the release of Supercross."
0," ... a myth in need of a makeover - but not this one. So little of Arthurian legend is preserved that this could be any blade swinger since Conan. No Guinevere, minimal Mordred and Merlin gets only a mention. Not a lotta Camelot."
0," As a comedy, The Man resembles a photo negative of Midnight Run, opposite in every possible way."
1," Watching Carell and Fey in action, trading quips and dodging gunfire as they attempt to make their way home to white-picket-fence suburbia, makes you wonder why it's taken so long to bring these two gifted comics together."
0, John needs to move on and leave Lara behind as the Next Three Days felt like three years. 
0," Exorcist: The Beginning makes the mistake of confusing loud noises, grotesque images, obscene violence, and buckets of blood for frights."
1," Fincher's strange romantic epic has its greatest impact the first time around. Overall, the film seems more like a beautiful curio than anything else, a sort of artsy fartsy Forest Gump."
1," It's exciting, foreboding, grand and important, a part of our culture and identity no matter how loudly cineastes scream bloody murder."
0," Rats has little of interest to say about its subject, little to provoke thought or argument, beyond which mode of death one finds more vile, or more unjustifiable as viewing material."
1, City of Men has the electrically oversaturated style of reality that made City of God such a searing vision of teenage criminal life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro.
1, ... a unique and engaging reworking of an enduring genre.
1, Depicts a side of Abraham Lincoln and the American political system that is equally stimulating and intellectually inspiring.
1, Slick and playful entertainment that remains carefully inoffensive beneath its veneer of bad manners.
1, The changes suit the demands of mainstream cinema and the warm aesthetic Batra exhibited in his first film. This is a smart piece of translation.
1," It's an exciting experience, dazzling and entertaining and thought-provoking."
1," The actors make these characters vivid, within a structure that is recognisably Malick's."
1, It's impossible to tell the experienced from the inexperienced among Loach's casts.
1,"Absorbing, often electric with the energy of the playing field, Invictus is packed with feel-good ""teachable moments"" without the sugary aftertaste."
0, Routine post-9/11 espionage thriller than leans far too heavily on ticks taken from far better Hitchcock films.
0,"...with more attention paid to shock than to storytelling, the violence and incredulity take the front seat..."
1," The film definitely has its moments, and at arm's length, The Promise will resonate. But overall, it feels like a missed opportunity, a good film that could have been much better."
1," The film builds steadily, but never tediously, to the long awaited mission to Abbottabad and the compound housing Osama bin Laden."
1,An entertaining comedy that far surpasses his previous American films.
1, There are definitely sentimental and predictable moments but it is enjoyable.
0," Friday Night Lights is a feel-good movie, but it's not real. It's a hard-hitting Hallmark greeting card. It's no wonder it appealed to Larry King %u2014 it's safe, easy, conventional, and feigns incisiveness."
0, The only thing keeping this movie from completely driving off the road is Alfre Woodard.
0, Makes the similarly themed Love Story seem positively sophisticated by comparison.
1," Hail, Caesar gives us a colourful feast full of excess and fun."
1, An inoffensive and relaxed offbeat comedy with just enough heart to carry it through.
1," Director Michael Polish and his co-scenarist and brother Mark don't fall into the trap of trying to redo Frank Capra. They have their own approach to the material, with an eye for the eccentric amid the commonplace adding just the right touch of humor."
1," The film's color photography is extraordinarily lovely for, like the conspirators within the film, Bertolucci has a weakness for the purely theatrical effect."
1," This is a modern day Capra movie, which means you might be embarrassed to tell your friends you went to see it, but you left the theater with a big smile on your face."
1," It's a story where, perhaps, there's enough guilt to go around. But the credit for telling it goes completely to a bright young talent."
0," The minus I give this children's story pains me...If I had seen this film when I was eight, I would have been terrified. "
0," Carl T. Evans's semi-autobiographical film is a modern-day Big Chill wannabe without the subtlety, humor, memorable soundtrack, strong performances or convincing dialogue."
1,Sam Peckinpah doesn't find anything to cheer about when his Man expresses his rage.
1, A true classic worthy of its highest praises.
1," ...we've seen all this before (""Bad Santa"" being but one example). Still, Murray is Murray and watching his sweetness peek through his outer curmudgeonly crust is worth the price of admission. More surprising is Naomi Watts..."
1," Even non-fans will get a thrill or two, followed by a quick laugh and a feeling like someone is trying to insult their intelligence."
1, A beautiful and shamelessly honest film about the fragility of life. [Full review in Spanish]
0, ...this could very well be the premise for an off-the-wall new sitcom...
0, The clichés are thick as the kudzu in 1956 Alabama.
0," Wild Grass is nearly the same movie as Amelie, only minus the charm and the appeal."
1," This 1930s-set drama chronicling events leading to the deportation of a little-known, real-life Irish political activist is a graceful digest of Loach's signature motifs."
0," Returning to Las Vegas but losing its winning streak, Ocean's Thirteen lets Soderbergh and the boys take a final bow while proving it is possible to have too much of a good thing."
0," Smith still has nothing to say, at least nothing printable, either as writer/director or as the dumb (as opposed to dumber) half of Jay and Silent Bob."
0," There is so much food, music, dancing and crying that you want to come out, at the end, and find a quiet place to watch paint dry. Unless, of course, you loved MBFGW1 and have spent 14 years waiting for MBFGW2."
0," Too much of it stretches credibility too far -- yes, even for a film designed to do just that -- and thus feels like the filmmakers took the easy way out and/or didn't have what it takes to make a smart, mindless movie. (Parental Review also Available)"
1," An examination of whether vigilante justice - no matter how well-intentioned at the start - is doomed, ultimately, to become just another example of would-be good guys falling prey to the lure of egotism and/or big money."
1," An authentic depiction of depression, mental illness, and a poetic meditation on mankind's relationship with the universe."
0," Well, Guy Ritchie sure put his stamp on this bit of British mythology. Lock, stock and flaming arrow."
1," The same effortless chemistry that made the comedians such ideal Golden Globes hosts is on full display in this broad comedy, given extra oomph by a wise and glorious R rating that opens the floodgates of creative vulgarity."
0," ""Skyscraper"" - part ""Die Hard,"" part Khalifa Tower sequence from ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol,"" part duct tape commercial - is patently absurd but never climbs to the heights of insanity it needs to transcend that and become something more."
1," Lovelace finds a fresh take on familiar material, but the film is also distinguished by its focus and intensity."
1," Nothing in Uncovered: The War on Iraq will change your opinion, but it may give you bullet points to back up your cocktail-party arguments."
0, Solamente una película más en la filmografía de Tim Burton
1, The show is fun and fact-filled. A smart peak into how the past informs the present that does right by taking the funny stuff seriously.
1," It's often at its best when it's off on a moody tangent. But it has something and is well worth seeing, especially if you're a horror fan or a fan of art cinema"
1," Sure, it's complicated, but isn't that always true of romance? And doesn't it blow the hinges off the universe -- every single time?"
1," This incarnation of Fanny may not have been what Austen had in mind, but she surely would have approved, for the injection of attitude and smarts makes Mansfield Park a much more wicked and irresistible social satire..."
0," The film seems nearly writer-free. Absolutely no time gets wasted on story, character development or logic."
1," [Director Dome] Karukoski guides us on a journey of reflection, where distance is not so much geographic, but emotional. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, Seems mainly about ripping off 1983's Risky Business without attribution.
1, [Oliver] Stone uses a lot of visual effects to give some energy to a very conventional story...
1," There's nothing like seeing Fela himself - blowing his sax, expressing his unbridled sexuality and living a life like no other."
0," Just about every other element of Hits, from its eagerness to snigger at the expense of small-town yokels to its sneering disdain for YouTube, leaves a sour taste."
0," It's also incredibly uneven, visually overworked and frequently substitutes noisy kinetic action for actual narrative momentum."
0," Despite the incongruous romance and abrupt action beats, Crowe gives a likable, sympathetic performance. But it all starts to dry up before our eyes."
1, A rather watchable film that is reminiscent of The Bodyguard (sans the stalker sub-plot) that also works well as warm-hearted romance with soap opera elements.
0, It's got enough melodrama and full-volume diva-meltdown histrionics to blow a movie like Burlesque out of the water.
0," Not very good, but not the utter embarrassment some seem to have expected."
0," Just routine undeadliness that puts the ""stink"" in ""extinction."""
0," A bittersweet relationship story presented in a glass case, with an accompanying music box, but it doesn't really earn this treatment."
1,"What Black's movie really has going for it is pace. It starts with a crash, followed swiftly by a bang and vast swathes of wallop. The relentlessness doesn't allow you any time to catch a yawn, but it's also not too conducive to tension or suspense."
1," Real-life love stories rarely work out quite so faultlessly, but for two hours it's nice to believe that they could."
1," Another year, another mix of ""The Amityville Horror"" and ""The Exorcist."" Solid acting and an emotional back story set this one slightly apart."
1," While prone to arty lingering, thus wasting time that would have been more wisely spent plugging gaps in the narrative, Shortland slathers the story in enough mud and horror to make it a compellingly visceral experience."
1," Boasts the stock characters and situations, sentimentality, foreshadowing and melodrama of soap opera. Yet by cleverly blending these ingredients with those of an action caper, the pic presents a fresher appeal."
0," The reveal is eye-rollingly bad, a moment of affected profundity Michod's long, winding road trip never earns."
1," Well, it's a more fun trip to Rio than Rio. As the reckless flailing of a lot of meatheads, Fast Five is essentially a food fight with sloppy Joes."
1, The Secret World of Arrietty is a marvelously captivating animated feature about very tiny people and the full-scale world they inhabit.
1,"The Mambo Kings"" is so pumped up with life it threatens to burst. It's beautifully filmed and flashily edited. It pulsates with rhythmic ecstasy. It throbs, it sweats, it pounds, it undulates."
1, The film does not disappoint despite having moments where it could have more nuance. [Full Review in Spanish]
1," It's not the deepest movie of the season, but it has sprightly performances and cinematic style to spare."
0," Once upon a time, fairy tales were told with beauty, wit, simplicity and charm, a tradition that seems increasingly a thing of the past in Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil."
0, An annoying little film that attempts to be lascivious but is merely ludicrous.
0, I've never cheered so hard for the monster to win in my life.
0, Some stunning visuals -- and some staggeringly boring cinema.
1," It's almost as if the whole Peanuts universe has been encased in Carbonite, shipped to 2015, then unfrozen like Han Solo, ready for movie duty."
1, Manages to surprise and engage the viewer in a way you may not have expected.
1," As it stands, it's an efficient, diverting new entry in Neeson's ongoing action canon, albeit one which suggests his He-Man career route has finally reached the end of the line."
0, This film has Eric Roberts and Don 'The Dragon' Wilson straight-to-DVD written all over it.
0," There's no need for character assassination here. But the absence of darker, more contradictory revelations of his nature leaves Che bereft of complexity. All that remains is a South American superman: uncomplex, pure of heart, defiantly pious and boring."
1, Tim Burton magic with just a touch of scariness.
1,"If the thought of another Australian film with a soundtrack full of ABBA songs scares you away from this film, buck up and see it anyway."
0,The tone seems as uneven as the pacing.
1, A horror-fantasy that all involved should be wholeheartedly proud to be a part of.
0," Part ""Frankenstein,"" part ""Freaks,"" the horror film/cautionary tale ""Splice"" is derivative and disturbing."
1," From a philosophical viewpoint it's fitting that the inaugural movie to unite martial arts legends Jackie Chan and Jet Li is a fantasy film for young teenagers. Forbidden Kingdom"" may not be ""Enter the Dragon,"" but it's not supposed to be."
1, Even basketball-phobes will enjoy it.
1, A superhero tale that feels fresh and new...
1, Star Andy Samberg & Co. are at their best when they're deadpanning as addlepated celebrity man-children whose vision of the good life involves the getting of ways and the indulging of whims.
1, Lelio's observational and unobtrusive direction trusts the lead to carry the weight of the film. Moore characteristically rises to the occasion.
1," There is a sense that the picture ends just as it gets going. But it's a movie that understands co-dependency from the inside, as well as the helplessness and hopelessness of trying to cure someone else's addiction."
0," I am the prime demographic for this movie, and I found it only sort of inoffensively blah. Chris Pratt: He's no Jeff Goldblum."
0,Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's name is far more exciting than his movie...
1, Your response to all this depends extremely heavily on how much philosophizing and pretty pictures you're willing to accept in lieu of a story.
1, Stephen King's The Mist is a reminder of what a great horror movie is all about.
0," [Meryl] Streep doesn't play her as a crusader; twice Kay walks into boardrooms, a lone woman among grim men, making no impression."
0," I don't know how fans of the title hero are going to take this adaptation, since I'm not familiar with the classic Hergé comic strip on which it's based, but followers of Steven Spielberg might regard it as a second-rate, animated Indiana Jones."
0," The We and the I is less a film than a social-studies experiment, an after-school project by a bunch of high-school kids exploring that eternal teen tension between the individual and the group. "
1," 3/4 is a small but ambitious drama with a perfectly symmetrical structure, using minimal means, nonprofessional actors, and everyday conversations to convey its characters' innermost feelings. "
0," Unfortunately, Fincher doesn't add much to Niels Arden Oplev's Swedish version: more Googling and plot-compressing montages and an altered but still convoluted ending."
1," Aaron Johnson may not be Lennon, but he?s entirely persuasive as someone who could have grown up to become him. It?s a striking pre-incarnation. "
1," Once you've been away from 'The Fall' for 24 hours or so, you reflect on its sheer beauty."
1, [F]eatures one of the most engaging ensemble casts I've seen in a goodly while... So hurrah for this band of gal pals at various romantic crossroads...
1, More of a dramatic freak-out than your standard teen slasher horror. Although the effect is exactly the same.
1, What Social Animals ultimately does is take us on a journey in order to see what Instagram users will do to be successful.
1,You can't help but walk out feeling as though you've just seen one of the more important stories about one of the more important people - gay or straight - of our time.
1," Ranks among the most mindless action films ever made, but scores as a helluva video game."
1," If you're not a fan of rocker David Crosby, director A.J. Eaton's comprehensive documentary ""David Crosby: Remember My Name"" might make you one - or at least give you an appreciation of this rock 'n' roll survivor."
0," By the time the story takes a dark turn towards ""war is bad"" lecturing, much of the loose, silly appeal of the early sequences fades into the white backgrounds. "
0, A romantic melodrama of a boringness to make your average tooth extraction seem preferable.
0," No, it's not as bad as you think. It's actually worse."
0," It's a film that carries on (carries on), but ultimately doesn't really matter. "
1, The first great film about the war in Iraq.
1, A deeply moving drama played out on the small stage of ordinary people's lives.
1," Iannucci made the bravura decision to make a factual film of that event dressed in the black robe of English satire at its darkest. Surely, there was no other intelligent way to bring the story to an audience 75 years after the event. "
0, The combination of Redford and Nick Nolte only manages to make this walk in the woods as exciting as a summer stroll.
1, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle breathes through its adventurous pores. [Full Review in Spanish] 
1," DeBlois, who also wrote the script, successfully juggles the multiple story lines, shifting allegiances and uncharted lands."
0," This movie just isn't good. The performances are all over the map, the central plot and action make no sense and there are huge chunks of screen time spent completely unnecessarily."
0," The film's one achievement is that it comprehensively discredits the concept of ""comedy violence"": the body count in the first 20 minutes leaves little room for guffaws."
1, Tedeschi combines the raw sensuality of an Anna Magnani with the melancholic introspection of a Monica Vitti and is well worth discovering.
1, Bulworth plays like a cry of frustrated comic rage. It's about an archetypal character who increasingly seems to stand for our national mood: the guy who's fed up and isn't going to take it anymore.
1," If you see no more than the opening shots, you will never forget them."
0," ""Who wants a life imprisoned in safety?"" Amelia asks in a voice-over. And you want to shout, ""This movie does, honey."" There's not a real or spontaneous minute in it."
1," Funny, feel-good movie has excellent messages for kids."
0," Lacks cohesion and chemistry, essential ingredients to the original's success."
0," Razor sharp editing keeps an extremely tight pace, but the wasted, non-rhythmic R-rated dialogue and an ensemble cast of morons leaves no-one to root for."
0," A queasy amalgamation of Awakenings, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Starman."
0,"You want the movie to stomp and rejoice and cry like a fool; instead it meanders and lollygags, occasionally flaring up, then sputtering again."
1," A vital, lavish, venomously profane two fingers up at Benefits Street pity porn and the social division it fosters. I laughed, winced, gagged, then laughed even more."
1, ... the protagonists of the film put ethics before ideologies and do not hesitate to confront their audience... [Full review in Spanish]
0," ... this is cinema as an immediate spectacle, pure surface. [Full review in Spanish]"
1," Even in its more banal moments, Oculus has its eye on a higher prize."
1,"A difficult film to describe without making it seem less than the masterpiece it is, 'Tokyo Story' is a remarkable work that gives a real insight into family life."
0, No one's likely to mistake this film for Harvard material.
0," Scherfig, who showed such subtlety in ""An Education,"" this time proves embarrassingly vulgar, giving the film the unfortunate aura of an angry leaflet being handed out on a street corner by a wild-eyed protester."
0," It manages, nonetheless, to shrink all narrative possibilities down into a bitty best-of compilation that's notable only for some horrendously bad science and a career-low performance from Gary Oldman."
1," A gentle film can still be searing in its effect on an audience, something that ""Monsieur Lazhar"" proves emphatically."
1," By the end, the film shows not only the power of this influence but also its terrible price in an often merciless conflict."
0,The plot's implausibilities -- and the energetic set pieces that Li and his kung-fu-fighting co-stars mount -- are mighty entertaining in and of themselves.
0, The filmmakers aren't really interested in the space between what these women say and what they mean.
1, This role fits Frank Langella to perfection as he plays away from the obvious comedy in search of greater truths.
1, It wasn't until the movie was over that I realized it had pulled off the neat trick of creeping me out without showing even a single drop of blood.
0," The Perfect Match looks and sounds increasingly like a romantic comedy created out of secondhand memories, vaguely described or poorly translated."
1," Director Mimi Leder admirably insisted on making the human relationships count for as much as the cheap thrills in this killer- comet movie. But the cheap thrills -- expensive thrills, actually -- are mostly what make Deep Impact fun to watch."
0," Even in a whiteout, you can see the plot twists coming."
0," Exorcisms, séances, scurrying phantoms, slamming doors, blood rituals, possessed children, upside-down crosses - The Offering leaves few horror devices unused."
1, A story that deftly sneaks up on you before grabbing your emotions by the throat. 
1,"Exhilarating, visually astounding, thought-provoking and very, very funny."
1," As a spun-sugar, slightly screwball romantic comedy, it's a delicious 'portal' to an hour and change of escapism."
1, It is obviously the film of a master and certainly feels like a swan song.
1," An instant cult classic, one that's tailor-made for multiple viewings and bound to be popular among college students."
0," [The] actors made the choice to treat this script as award-worthy material instead of the hilarious schlock it is, and the performances are gorgeously melodramatic. "
1, Requires an expertise in Austen's works but rewards you with a decadently satisfying ending - a guilty pleasure.
1," Cast and director come together a treat in a fascinating attempt to revise the western that satisfies visually, emotionally and intellectually."
0, The saccharine-coated treatment of people struggling to learn how to forgive themselves and others takes on the ring of sentimental greetings inside a Hallmark card.
0, A mirthless comedy about venal people doing stupid things.
1," It's handsomely mounted, extremely well-acted and tells a little-known story of bravery on the part of one man daringly taking on the might of the Third Reich."
1,Gary Fleder directs this thriller with panache making the most of interlocking elements of the drama.
0," Explicitly, the film is pure fluff, a competently detailed catalog of Lennon's political ambitions told in the visual shorthand of the VH1 rock-doc."
1," Because of its gruesome subject matter, it is difficult to describe such a vile movie as being good, or even well made, but this one really is."
0," I'm beginning to believe that the minds behind The Hunger Games franchise are closer in spirit to President Snow and his sinister, heartless showmanship than to Katniss and her bravery and passion."
1, Solid summer entertainment.
0, If the viewer is expecting a mystery he will be disappointed. This is a story of a woman who has lost her husband and what her uncertainty does to her.
0, The film is too timid to offend or amuse.
1," Cheesy? A bit, but using 3-D to enhance the dance floor feels more honest than the dull 3-D of The Last Airbender."
0, an intriguing crime saga that is long on atmosphere and short on momentum
0,Are we giving mediocre movies a pass for convenience? Are we rewarding them for just not giving us any time to build up expectations that could be disappointed?
0," The first feature film from ""Funny or Die..."" director Jordan Vogt-Roberts, ""The Kings of Summer"" isn't very funny and dies slowly but surely as a coming-of-age film that bludgeons the viewer with its own quirkiness."
1," The film has already won several awards at film festivals, and once you see it, you'll understand why people are clamoring to see Colin Firth win an Academy Award."
1," Buster Keaton's final independent film is one of his finest achievements, something of a greatest hits package in its refinement of old routines."
0," So much of the movie exists for the sole purpose of driving its plot and culling some sort of emotion from the audience, that ultimately, you can feel just how empty it is."
1, ... filmmakers hit pay dirt when they got Weiner to sit for them. He's an impassioned self-deceiver who's not afraid to infiltrate enemy territory ... Now if he could only keep his namesake in his pants.
1,"There's a self-aware feel to the period pageantry, the alternatingly seductive and kinetic cinematography, and the actor's showcase this ramshackle contraption has been held together with spit and bailing wire to be."
1," To her credit, Ms. Reichardt never allows her camera to become a voyeuristic witness to a young woman in distress. Instead, it remains focused on a largely indifferent American landscape of strangers in perpetual motion to nowhere."
0," ... a myth in need of a makeover - but not this one. So little of Arthurian legend is preserved that this could be any blade swinger since Conan. No Guinevere, minimal Mordred and Merlin gets only a mention. Not a lotta Camelot."
1,"L'Auberge Espagnole"" isn't a perfect, or at times very even, film, but it's chock-full of a kind of experimentation and fun rarely found in the slick, polished and ready for the masses fare that the studios usually traffic in"
1," If you can stay awake, you'll be struck by the nuanced performances, the depth of the characterisation, the intensity of the moral questions and the drips of black humour."
1," [Achieves] level of visceral intensity that rivals the jacked-up, heart-in-mouth tension that was previously the preserve of the best fiction film-makers."
0," When audience members cheer for the ferocious killers-on-the-rampage, it really makes you wonder about our cultural values today - and society in general."
0, A jumble of kiddie slapstick and pointless chases.
1," This ""Dawn of the Dead"" inspired chiller is strong on concept, style and brutally violent action, but suffers from poor musical scoring, and a digital video format that helped keep its budget at 10 million dollars."
0, Reynolds and Jackson's cross-country bromance might have raised a smile if only writer Tom O'Connor had bothered to give their characters something remotely funny to say on the journey.
1, A style and tone as impressive as its action.
1, A film with a developed staging and that creates an interesting dialectic between reality and fiction through images. [Full review in Spanish]
1,"It doesn't want to explore epistemological questions about the nature of perception and memory; it just wants to mess with our heads. And as a wily, slightly sadistic chess game of a movie, it succeeds quite nicely."
1," Like the best ad man, he makes his point by making us laugh."
1, The stealthiest comedy since American Psycho.
1," A challenging but worth-it experience for more reasons than one can actually speak (or write) in words. It's a documentary to be watched over time, with a Carthusian level of contemplation."
1," Just because the characters are crazy, that doesn't mean they are not smart."
1, belies its low budget with both an impressive cast headed by veteran character actors and director Bob Clark's creative economy
0, [Feels] more like the pilot of episode of a short-lived CW series than a feature-length motion picture.
1, This is one of the screen's most rewarding explorations of the teacher/student relationship in any language. Every voice we hear makes sense; every opinion means something.
0," Some of what follows is amusing and even touching, but none of it fully capitalizes on the cast's star wattage."
1," Goes solely for today's oversaturation of superheroes and jabs it for all its worth. In-jokes, Easter eggs, and background details abound throughout. I highly enjoyed this film. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, etc. - also Available)"
1," Radcliffe's first post-Potter outing is plenty atmospheric, in the style of Roger Corman's Poe series. It's just not all that scary ‒ unless you find rattling doorknobs and dead children's faces pressed to frosty windows scary."
0," It's the content that's to blame. Signs works on a confused storyboard. What's Shyamalan trying to say anyways? Nothing, or rather a bit too much."
1," Adult horror returns to the screen with the crisp and frightening The Orphanage, a haunted-house tale about the dueling forces of childhood friendship and maternal love."
0, Saccharine piffle unredeemed by its two talented stars.
1, [T]here's... an oddly poignant attempt to redeem a hackneyed genre from pointless insensitivity.
1," Under The Sand lifts the phantom-spouse syndrome to the level of art, yet another dimension for this popular form."
0," Tears of the Sun is war fluff for the lobotomized Hollywood crowd, a transparent and thin effort without rhythm, depth, thrust or even basic structure."
1," Aside from the silly title and disappointingly pat ending, even the rom-com-averse will find something to love about Man Up."
0," You'll probably laugh, and you'll probably wish it were better."
1," If I myself find anything worth worshipping, it's the creative genius of people like M. Night Shyamalan, at whose feet I am not worthy to grovel."
0," This, my friends, is soft-core porn at its rancid worst. Shame on you, Will Ferrell and Adam McKay for producing this swill that features some of the most unlikeable characters ever put to film."
0, This movie's idea of psychology is Freudian at its most risqué.
1," The film is meant to be a negotiation of what that long-ago relationship was, and it is that. But in our reality of pervasive sexual iniquity, it also feels an awful lot like a litany of self-serving excuses for pedophilic behavior."
0," The film never becomes great until the final act. The rest of the film seems fake, even if it is inspired by actual events."
1,"It is entertaining and often very funny, even when you hope that director Harron will next find a subject that is truly worthy of her considerable talents."
0, I was really glad when it was over.
1," Hysterically potent, thought-provoking and deliciously nostalgic. Overall, the proposed chatter is warranted in the movingly impish Talk to Me."
0," This self-styled self-reflexive comedy asks the question, just how stupid are teenagers?"
1,"Channeling spaghetti westerns, Cervantes, Castaneda, and a dash of CHINATOWN as refracted through the visual sensibilities of Dali, it is a fiendishly clever concretion of high- and low-brow in a story that is both vision quest and farce"
0," Fanboys won't mind the absence of depth or emotion; they may even welcome it for making the film more representative of its comic-book origins. The rest of us, however, cannot rejoice at the overspending and overkill likely to come in Hellboy III."
0," As expected, all the humour involves his bumping into things and falling over because he's fat, which is apparently hilarious."
0," It's quite the emotional journey, going from peering through our fingers to derisive chuckles."
0," The movie plays like the kind of line a rich older guy would lay on a teenage model, suppressing his own intelligence and irony in order to spread out before her the wonderful world he would like to give her as a gift."
1,"Personally, it's my favorite out of the four Vacation films. Many people don't agree with me, however."
1," Great acting, sharp visuals, but edited in such a confusing way that a second viewing might be needed."
0," Cameron strives for a quirky magic realism that she can't quite pull off. The leads are all fine, and some of the photography achieves an iridescent wonder. But the film's plotting is messy and its tone uneven."
0, The biggest disappointment of the summer movie season.
0," If there were a way to switch off the dialogue, leaving the images, music and layered soundscape, Knight of Cups would be wondrous. As it is, it's a bit of an endurance test."
0," Be sure to say ""I don't"" to License to Wed"
0," Smith gives a fine lead performance, peeling away his usual affectations to expose his natural charm, but Omalu never becomes a fully developed character."
1," In Loach's hands, it has a measure of dignity and it works beautifully."
1," ... it isn't trying to be a blockbuster, and yet it out-blockbusters almost everything else this summer... "
0," If Santa Claus had a fever dream fueled by figgy pudding indigestion and an egg nog bender, his subsequent Yuletide hallucinations would probably look tame compared to Disney's aggressively opulent phantasmagoria."
1," It's not Lee's most challenging work, but it's certainly amongst his most charming."
1," ""The Great Gatsby"" not so great, but pays a decent tribute to the novel."
1," Despite the predictable body-shifting premise and a heavy dose of sentimentality, this teen comedy is extremely enjoyable"
1, Depp terrifies as dangerously violent real-life gangster.
0, [A] lazy kidnap caper.
1, This is a very accomplished movie.
0," Despite some earnest laughs and a sincere heart, Call can't seem to rise above its TV sitcom styling."
0," Peck...reduces Baldwin's in-the-moment reflections and once-daring insights to the petulance of the Black Lives Matter crusade, which overturns the principles and virtues that King, Malcolm, and Medgar represented before their deaths."
1, Bigelow crowns several decades of excellent artistic enquiry with a film that everybody should see.
0, A disastrous effort to establish the popular comic as a leading man.
0," The globetrotting adventure yarn extensively, and energetically, riffs on Indiana Jones's signature moments. You'll wish that its storytelling polish matched its enthusiasm."
1," If it can get someone who's so out of its core demographic a little verklempt, imagine what it can do for someone who's a target for such fare."
1, X-Men earns another shot at being a seminal comic-book franchise.
1," The Eyes of My Mother is effective and unsettling, and as a first movie from Pesce, promises much more in the future."
1," In one of his last films films to be released, the late Philip Seymore Hoffman gives another of his pitch-perfect performances in this twisted spy yarn set in Hamburg, Germany."
0," Stuck on auto-pilot, and therefore, comes off as a tiresome excursion into terrain that has been covered too many times to count."
1," ""Aquarius"" is a marvelous and surprising act of portraiture, a long, unhurried encounter with a single, complicated person."
1," quirky, off-beat and all around charming... has a lot of heart."
1," Genius nudges its nose, or maybe just the brim of its fedora, ahead of a lot of prestige biopics."
0, Something feels like it's missing. [Full Review in Spanish] 
0, It's an Eastwood film that very nearly strikes the same unsophisticated but delicate tone of his obligatory end-credits ditty.
1, Intense and delicately nuanced.
0," ""The Ward"" is bland shock therapy from the guy who reinvented bloody peek-a-boo with the classic ""Halloween."""
0, Despite good work done by some of the cast this post-apocalyptic cannibal tale wanders in the desert for far too long. 
1," Warm, darkly humorous, bittersweet and tender. Rolf Lassgård is a revelation. "
0," Despite some legitimate signs of life, Evolution isn't fit enough to survive."
0, A big disappointment. All the pretty vistas in the world can't enliven this protracted futuro-slog.
1," That doesn't dampen the work of Richardson and Sprouse, or the romance at the film's center. ""Five Feet Apart"" works hard for its tears. But it's the honesty of the performances that makes it worth the investment."
0,"It's interesting in how very dated it has become, but all of that interest is extra-textual."
0," If you must, go for the scenery."
0," It's a headache-inducing mishmash of waving curtains, hyperactive fades, aggressive zooms, and Baz basically just throwing things at the lens (confetti, champagne, fabric, Tobey Maguire)."
0," ""The film is a saddening bore,"" David Bowie sang in ""Life on Mars,"" a tune from a far more optimistic era. It ain't quite as bad as that, but it ain't much."
0, So what is missing? A little of the original's madness and a lot of its aesthetic high-wire walking.
0," Bay seemingly relishes in tainting childhood memories, so why would this be any different?"
0, Niccol's metaphor gets silly fast.
0,"An uneasy mix of post-modern, self-referential archness and spaghetti Western bravado that's not likely to please anybody."
0, A movie with no heart or soul.
1, A lavish rehash of the 1967 Disney classic that takes computer-generated fakery to new heights.
1, A convoluted tale of corruption within the ranks of the police
1," While the hidden agenda that eventually surfaces does strain credibility, Foster's ability to reign in the improbable ... allows this flight to deliver the requisite thrills."
1," Ozon apparently delights in making every possible kind of movie, often several at the same time."
1, The repercussions of violence are compiled into different shorts where you will inevitably favour some stories more than others.
0," The Hunting Party has good aim, but just misses."
0," Unfortunately, as beautifully presented as it is, and no matter how creepily authentic the autopsied and rotting cadavers look, Post Mortem is D.O.A. in the suspense department."
0," It's excerpt-ready for the Oscars, with the little blocks of conflict quickly precipitated and solved in a fast minute. The self-congratulation is thick."
1,It offers the most awesomely plausible account of Tibetan life and culture ever seen in the west. It's one of the few films whose images show you things you've never seen before.
1,"Mildred may be a literal and figurative flame-thrower, but out of senseless violence and righteous revenge emerges an empathy that hints at redemption."
0," There's no care that went into making anything other than the lighting rigs for The Possession of Hannah Grace, and you shouldn't care about it, either."
0, Peter Jackson definitely knows what he's doing. He just didn't do it this time.
1, The animation is amazing from start to finish: a never-ending feast for the eyes.
0," Scene after scene of a sputtering Hart and a glowering Ice Cube, despite the fact that they were brilliantly funny in, respectively, Think Like a Man and Barbershop, their previous collaborations with director Tim Story."
1, Powerful documentary addresses critically important issue for kids.
0," The pacing is fine but the dialogue is trite. Older children and adults will also find the main plot and Smurf gibberish tedious, redeemed only by Azaria's performance and a sideplot involving Gargamel."
1, Director Mike Mendez brings his homage to those wacky creepy-crawly flicks of yesteryear to life with enough energy for several films.
1," Bryan Barber's first feature also tweaks gangster movie conventions with brilliant choreography, hip-hop beats, and inventive images."
0, mostly forgettable
1," Although Gameau's film includes a fair amount of science, he and his helpers sweeten the film's statistics, delivering them in clever, accessible ways."
0," Arctic becomes an exercise in moralistic, idiotic sadism, with the woman he's paired up with coming off a plot device, an excuse to throw more obstacles in the way of a man who's too skilled to encounter many of them on his own."
0," IO is just not very riveting, character or plot-wise. And that's saying something when the fate of the planet, the greatest human drama of all, hangs in the balance."
0," Emmerich and Kloser don't know when to quit, the last half hour in particular such a wet noodle slog of turgid awfulness any good will I might have had disappeared just about as quickly as California did into the gurgling waters of the Pacific."
1, The state of the Muppet union remains strong...self-reference sits comfortably along hip pop-cultural references for the 'rents: stylish parodies and retro musical numbers along with vintage Muppet gags...
1, Battle is an extremely well-made movie artistically and should be kept in the game as a contender for critics' honors and the Oscars at the end of the year.
0," If you smile at the thought of giant robots fighting giant monsters, del Toro has crafted a cinematic love letter specifically with you in mind. Those not immediately sold on the premise should sit this installment of Rock'Em Sock'Em robots out."
0," Though minor arcs play out in each piece, Dare lacks an overarching narrative to propel the entire film, so overall pacing feels uneven and long at just 90 minutes."
0," The first film was a summer action movie masterpiece, this one can't even make giant, transforming robots stay interesting for its entire running time."
1," Part history lesson, part classic adventure tale and often stunning to watch."
1," Look through the haze of weed and the raunchy jokes and you'll see a movie that's grown up with its audience, its subject matter and its subjects--and gotten even funnier in the process."
1, The saga of one man's quest for the perfect wife is both funny and revealing about modern-day Indians maneuvering through and contending with Western culture and influences.
1," The movie seems to drift instead of sail. But when you're a grown-up, you realize it's not about the destination, but the journey."
0," Sitting through this stage-bound, talky, stiffly-acted movie reminded me of having to endure the Hall of Presidents attraction at Walt Disney World."
0, This limp late-18th-century doodle sullies our memories of Austen's books and warps our impressions of the writer with pedestrian comedy-drama.
1,This is about on par with the best Star Trek movies.
1," There's nothing original here, but the film is pleasant enough, and it's a pleasure to see Elizondo on the screen again. Peña, Obradors and Mello are fine as well."
1,"Part thriller, part mind-bending absurdity, it will definitely leave you scratching your head. But try to stay until the end--it might make up for the rest of it."
0," Absolutely ludicrous, dramatically clumsy, fifty shades of wrong, but...If audiences can cool their loins long enough, they may have a productive think about the nature of their desires..."
1," If you love the music of Motown and enjoy a feel good success flick, then ""The Sapphires"" fits the bill."
1," This is one of those movies you forgive its plot holes and lazy scripting, because the laughs are so prevalent and the chemistry of the cast remains so spot-on. (Full Content Review for Parents also Available)"
1," ""Captain Phillips"" is riveting - a movie anchored by strong performances in which the human drama is as compelling as the overall story arc."
1, Spanish-language romcom's mature themes may not translate.
0," Some directors, it must be said, only have one really good movie in them. We're starting to worry that Richard Kelly may be among this select group."
0," The key attraction of these pictures is their portrayal of dinosaurs in the modern age. Unfortunately, this movie places greater focus on humanity's flaws, further questioning whether people deserve to experience their magnificence."
0," A generic, non-descript bit of punctuation at the end of a series that deserved something more and just couldn't leave well enough alone."
0," The movie will wash over adolescent female audiences who don't know any better like melted Brie on 110-degree asphalt, but for the rest of us it's a grueling waste of time."
1," Once you get past the fact that it's not the comedy its trailers imply, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot has some unexpected strengths."
0," With stars of the echelon of Kristin Scott Thomas and Sergi Lopez, it is terribly disappointing to find that the vehicle that brings them together is not only unworthy, but nonsensical"
1, Has an outstanding central performance from Winstead that demonstrates Kate's emotional and intellectual understanding of the complexities of alcoholism.
1," Though mourning is a part of the human cycle, Morning is not an easy film to watch -- save for the great acting by the entire cast."
0," The acting is often as flat as the L.A. sunshine looks in this movie, and the whole thing just has a too-obvious feel to it; as if the makers watched ""The Player"" a few too many times."
0," If you put the collected works of Will Ferrell, Adam McKay and Judd Apatow in a pot, boiled off the excess and let the remainder cool, you'd have something very much like Step Brothers."
1," There's greater consistency to it, and considerably more humor, with macabre slapstick and fun-house ghoulishness that, at their best, recall early Tim Burton."
0, A musical with energy and talent to burn but missing its heart.
1," The Hate U Give is powerful and should be compulsory viewing. Its simple approach to these complex issues is appreciated, and makes its clear point accessible to the young audience for whom it was created."
1, ... does a wonderful job of laying out not only the stakes but the process in a way that even someone who has never paid attention to football can understand...
1," As a model for how to bring substance, authenticity and insight to the biggest of adventure yarns, this trilogy will not soon, if ever, find its equal."
1," Like the best kids' entertainment, this creates a daffy little world all its own."
1," ""I need you to be patient with this story,"" a key character says to young Ben, and it's good advice for those of us in the audience as well."
1, It manages to be both funny and endearing because Field knows to play both the external comedy and the internal drama.
1, The story carefully sets up the question of rationality versus superstitious spirituality.
0," The party got out of hand towards the end, and we probably should have booked out before we got too tired."
1," Nolte finds real sympathy for Katz and delivers a compellingly watchable performance, even if you're slightly afraid he'll keel over at any moment."
0," The problem with Vantage Point, or at least one problem, is that it depends too much on coincidence. The film relies on things breaking a certain way for nearly every plot advancement."
0," On the whole, Hart's material veers toward the lowbrow and doesn't quite hit the heights of cleverness, talent, language, or delivery that predecessors like Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, and Chris Rock reached."
1,...a watchable yet disappointing work from a filmmaker whose best days are clearly behind him.
1," This is truly an art film in every sense of the word. ...if you don't have at least a rudimentary background in Russian history, you'll probably find the whole project a snooze. One man's dreamy odyssey is another man's invitation to nap."
0," [The] script by Shauna Cross (""Whip It"") ... leans too heavily on sentimentalism and thick slabs of cliché-filled narration."
1," One of the most ambitious Hollywood films of the 80s, Reds is trying to do too much (historical epic, political expose, and romance), but the insertion of interviews with contemporaries of John Reed is original and poignant."
1," I liked the set-up and the mythology. The villain took me out of it a lot, but other than that, I enjoyed the ride."
0," An occasionally exciting criminal informant drama that struggles to form much of an identity of its own, and takes too long to get where it's going."
0,"Sure, MacFarlane can write simple jokes as long as the 'f' key on his laptop holds out. Some of them are even funny. But a lot of them don't pay off, and most trod the same well-worn territory -- potheads, practical jokes, politically-incorrect cliches."
1," Zellweger does a nice job keeping her character more sympathetic than pathetic, as the realization that she is no longer an ingénue lets her become something more."
0," Rather than recalling the master of suspense, it brings to mind a straight-to-video cheapie you'd find in Blockbuster circa 1992."
1," Ross Partridge directed, wrote the screenplay (from a novel by Bonnie Nadzam) and delivers the strong central performance. He keeps us on edge in all three capacities ..."
1,"Still Alice is rarely anything short of compelling, in part because its sense of progression and scale offers such a distinctively unsentimental take on the terminal-countdown tearjerker."
1, Fred Flinstone in the land of the Jetsons
1," It's Zayas who anchors Shine. His gravitas shot through with mischief sets the film's tone, showing that serious-minded storytelling can still be fun."
1," While rarely feeling heavy-handed, Lez Bomb manages to be both over-the-top funny and yet incredibly realistic, sans the doom and gloom of yesteryear. "
1," Music and a deep love it is the jumping off point for this documentary directed by Peter Michael Dowd (The Beautiful Life). Mr. Jimmy is about Akio Sakurai and his love for Led Zeppelin's guitarist, Jimmy Page. "
0, Feels a lot like a B-movie from the 1950s.
1," The blood-slicked, vividly drawn film universe John Wick illustrates is such a generous slice of pulp that, even if not original, per se, it exudes a confidence rarely seen these days, surefire franchises be damned."
0," It's a comedy that's chosen to build itself on some pretty heavy issues, issues which it's all for addressing with some pretty horrible ideas about the way relationships work."
0," Apparently Darwin was wrong. If natural selection truly existed, Evolution never would have gone into production."
0," Argento's Dracula 3D is an absolute travesty of a film completely devoid of creativity or imagination. It's like taking your favorite folklore, stripping it of everything you love, making it as dull as possible, and then lighting it on fire."
0," Sentimental, but not exactly meaningful."
1," A dazzling, computer-animated fish tale with a funny, touching script and wonderful voice performances that make it an unqualified treat for all ages."
0," We get straightforward narration and expository dialogue that introduces each time-traveling vignette and dictates Hoover's tiresome ""me versus them"" rationalizations for whatever unscrupulous thing he did to stop them."
1," It gives you two choices: find it delightful or don't: there is no unique, self-guided option. As frustrating as that conundrum may be, it's still hard not to take option one."
0," This mess of tracking shots of deserts, roads and rotating love interests stubbornly refuses to coalesce into anything resembling a narrative film. "
1, In a Ruiz film one must expect a work that is obscure and mysterious.
1," It's too bad that the movie isn't as vibrant, funny, and entertaining as the community it wishes to represent - but it's a start."
0," Soderbergh is clearly captivated, as are we all, by the rot underlying the glitz, but even with Douglas' nuanced performance, the film simplifies too many things."
1," Little Men could've easily been called Life Is Strange - and, like its predecessor, much hinges upon the work of its cast. "
0, The premise... demands more heat and complexity than this hokey 2016 drama provides.
0, It isn't the dull midlife crisis movie it initially presents itself as. But it also doesn't do enough to lurch into more nightmarish territory.
0, The film is a mixed bag with the promise of a better sequel.
0, Let's just say that Ron Paul supporters will probably embrace The Crash and the theories it comes up with.
1," E.T. texted a homey, Spielberg paid the earth-bound ticket, and now we have Super 8."
0," Existing less as a feature film and more as an excuse for endless celebrity cameos, Zoolander, No. 2 is a lazy and often painfully unfunny sequel."
0, Bog standard horror offering with a distinct lack of action or plot.
1, An arguably brilliant film with the noncontradictory potential to bore half its intended audience and enchant the other half.
0, Modest in the least engaging sense of the term.
0," A 154-minute film that is both too much and not enough -- too much boxing, too many hours to sit, and too few connections."
1,The movie is a success on its own terms because the director doesn't condescend to pop music.
1, This is a wild movie in a Lynch-lite mode.
0, A meticulous killer with family issues; a cop with problems of her own; secondary murderers on the loose; a plot with unexplored depths - this could have been a decent TV series.
0," Oh for a smarter story, with a brisker pace, to support such excellent talents. At least we still get to experience the good, the bad and, if not the ugly, then the so-so."
0," Unfortunately, beyond the gender shift, The Heat's principal characters aren't particularly funny creations. "
1, Just the mechanics of getting to the roof are fun -- filled with surprise allies and strokes of luck and last minute escapes.
1," Everytime you think the movie can't surprise you more, something even more stunning happens to leave you breathless. [Full review in Spanish]"
1," You may get a headache trying to decipher the ponderous storyline, but the amazing imagery will likely soothe your pain."
1," In the case of The Dirty Dozen, there isn't any camaraderie -- virtually every character in the film is a misfit and proud of it -- and, yet, it's probably one of the best entries in the genre."
1," Life is a B movie on an A budget, an old-fashioned creature feature that delivers its cheap thrills expensively."
1," If midget wrestlers with troll masks don't make you laugh, well... I guess you and I don't laugh at the same things."
0," We've seen it a million times before, and better. The situations are forced, the script is weak, the pace drags and, frankly, it just isn't funny enough."
0, Those singing-and-dancing trolls will likely appeal mainly to younger viewers. Older moviegoers might experience a cloyingly sticky sensation that isn't caused by the soda-splattered floor beneath their feet.
0," While not wholly unenjoyable, the film lacks the necessary urgency and purpose required to hold anyone's attention ... Even the most avid David Byrne fans will be left checking their watches."
1," Wright's movie delivers action that's convincing and concrete - the cars seem real, even when the people don't."
0," The audience is subject to a constant tone of foreboding danger, but The Box is more tease than delivery."
0," Farhadi's films are suffused with an oppressive atmosphere, and there is something increasingly formulaic in his storytelling."
1," It's atmospheric, terrifying, and brilliant in its intricately placed bouts of horror and suspense."
0, [Its] thriller machinations are merely a vehicle to deliver narrow-minded political preaching.
0," Dracula Untold has a surprisingly soft bite -- succumbing to PG-13 level violence. It's a movie that clearly allowed the film to expand to a larger audience, but it also takes away some of the suspense and menace."
1, Giddily preposterous.
1," It's not perfect - Ferguson's Morgana is disappointingly all talk and no action until the final act - but The Kid Who Would Be King boasts plenty of heart, thrills and fun."
0, The stunts in Need for Speed are real: No computer pixels were harmed in the making of this film. It's the people who are fake.
1," I wasn't expecting to gain any kind of apotheosis or epiphany from watching Neville's documentary about Mister Rogers, but that's precisely what happened. Life is weird that way."
0, I know it's not fair to compare the new songs in Mary Poppins Returns to the classic songs from Mary Poppins that I've known as long as I've been alive. I'm just comparing them to recent musicals when I say I will never remember any of these songs.
1," As an actor, Mortensen carries an aura of hidden depths below false affability that's just right for the character."
0," A film that gets better at the end, but it's not enough to save it. Too bad because it had more to offer. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Like many of its brethren, the movie seems to love itself while hating its characters."
1," Violence, as the title indicates, may not be for the squeamish. But it is for those looking for answers to important questions."
0," It delivers to expectations, more or less, but it's never amazing."
0,There's probably a sweet little comedy hidden somewhere in Orange County. It's just too bad it's mired amidst so many small-minded pratfalls.
0,The stream of celebrity cameos cannot make up for a script that is less sharp than its predecessor's.
0," Big, bloated and only intermittently amusing."
0," Man, is this movie mentally deficient. We're talking Wheel of Fortune stupid."
0," Perhaps King's novel builds to something, but the film Dreamcatcher makes the mistake of being predominantly about its disconnected horror and science fiction staples."
1," While bogged down in questionable choices, this film manages to be an effective self-portrait of the dilemma faced by millions of undocumented immigrants in America today."
1," It's an intimate look at the gears inside one person's head and a study of how an obsession, when handled judiciously, can be enlightening."
1,"My tepidly positive reaction to Hereafter comes as a pretty big surprise, given my feelings about Eastwood's recent work."
1,The joy of Beetlejuice is its completely bizarre -- but perfectly realized -- view of the world.
1," I, Tonya aims for a different kind of retroactive justice. Gillespie and Rogers argue that Kerrigan actually had chances to shine on an international stage that Harding never got."
0," The subplot turns what might have been a fascinating true-life adventure into a lurid, stereotypical melodrama."
1," This documentary captures her colorful, childlike gift and wild times, but it lacks a narrator to clarify things it keeps vague."
0," There's a fair amount to appreciate about ""Ratchet & Clank,"" especially its desire to send up the genre conventions at play here. It's a shame, then, that the movie ultimately finds itself becoming so conventional."
0," Out of dozens of ways to make an intriguing and potential fun new franchise, American Assassin whiffed on all of them. "
1," A combination 'Memento'-like tale of a brain-damanged young man and taut, suspenseful bank-heist actioner."
0," Even with a brief 85-minute running time, The Return feels padded, which is odd considering how little we're told about the characters or the central mystery."
0,"Alternately frustrating and disappointing, Casa de los Babys is truly one of Sayles' lesser efforts."
1," Worth seeing for the last half hour, but too much of the film is dull. Waiting to reveal Godzilla would have been fine if the characters had heart or if the film had tension. "
1," Ramin Bahrani's talent for orchestrating sequences of tightly wound tension is in full bloom here, as is his complementary knack for quieter grace notes."
1," But nothing could prepare me for what does indeed transpire, the final scenes having a grotesque opulence that is both entrancing and disgusting all at the same time."
0," There is virtually no chemistry between the lead characters, something that dooms ""Aloha"" to be less than mediocre. Well, at least everyone got a paycheck."
1, Remains a defining high point of Hollywood's tumultuous relationship with superheroes.
0, Burn After Reading is the Coens' most mediocre film in a long time: a desperately strained black comic farce.
0,"Though this sequel probably has more creative energy than its predecessor, the constant stream of one-liners and sight gags is very much hit or miss."
0," An over indulged, overlong film that has some gem-like moments but also repetitiveness and preciosity."
1," This is hard-R action done old-school style. If that's your game, then gather up and throw in."
1," There are few things better than a flawlessly executed heist thriller, and while ""The Bank Job"" is not that film, it certainly comes close."
1," The new film is more disciplined and less scattershot than Apatow's previous films -- and slightly less funny, too. But only slightly."
1,"A Most Wanted Man is exactly what you'd expect from the director of The American, and while that assessment will mean different things to different people the film remains a meticulously crafted adaptation of John le Carre's bestselling novel."
0," What hasn't advanced is the plotting, which was nothing special last time and is so formulaic now that it's basically surprise-free."
0," Though he tries to avoid romcom cliches, Gormican doesn't find much to replace them with and the film ends up with only its three-stranded story distinguishing it from standard examples of the genre."
1, Mac gets a rare opportunity to showcase his true dramatic range as an actor.
1," The new ""Ben-Hur"" is impressive but not epic. The memory of Charlton Heston in that chariot race still remains"
0," Moments are stretched. Every recollection must be illustrated by a flashback. Character motivations shift on a dime, and if you understand even half of what's going on -- not generally, but specifically -- you'll be doing better than most."
1," Anomalisa is an existentialist discourse about time, longings, frustrations, setbacks and disappointments. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0," Fyre Fraud hoists Billy McFarland up as a straw man indictment against millennials, casting aside a thorough examination of the festival in favor of cheap laughs. "
0," Universal Pictures were so preoccupied with whether they could make a sequel, they didn't stop to think if they should."
0, A baby-boomer masturbatory center
1," In a strangely perverse way -- and thanks to the solid performances of the two leads -- the love story of Zack and Miri is more touching than you might expect, given the film's grungy setting and essentially sordid theme."
0," Bad films are easy to make, but a film as unpleasant as Baby Geniuses achieves a kind of grandeur."
0," If you're going to make the first mainstream movie about autism since ""Rain Man,"" maybe don't feature an anti-hero who's highly adept at shooting people in the head."
0," To call Mr. Turner one of the year's most overrated films seems unfair, as it's worth watching for beautiful cinematography and a plethora of gentle laughs."
1," The joyous movie Battle of the Sexes covers every inch of the court -- as an inspirational sports drama, as a riotous comedy, as a tender romance and as an insightful biography of King and her pivotal role in the fight for women's equality."
1," Never before have I experienced a picture that could have been so good and that had so much going for it, that blew it so badly."
1," A vibrant exercize and a good enoguh portrait of a sociey that showed the world how to consolidate democracy, yet found itself back under the same opressive regime. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," A couple of cruel stepsisters are thrown in to push the Cinderella angle, but their asinine antics merely highlight first-time screenwriter Leigh Dunlap's stunning lack of talent and imagination."
1," There is so much going on, filmed with such style, that I found it hard to stop being fascinated."
1, An unusually delicate tale about how to cope with an alien arrival on Earth.
0, Into the Woods left me out in the cold.
0," Famously dense though I am when it comes to plot twists, I had this one at hello."
0," The Madea franchise is premised on her excessive characterization, and audiences love the character. Still, she can be repetitive, and this film is unevenly paced and predictable."
0," Many films open on a high and drop off, but you'll rarely see a plunge as vertiginous as the one in The Lego Batman Movie."
0, A smaller work than a great president deserved
0," Good luck ascribing a clear satirical agenda to Jonathan Levine's tonally uneven zomcom, which suffers an identity crisis nearly as severe as its protagonist's."
0, The Broken Circle Breakdown doesn't jerk tears. It attempts to extract them by using enhanced interrogation techniques.
0," The idea has potential and the cast that John Turturro has assembled is delicious, yet Fading Gigolo falls flat"
0, An opportunity to wallow in grimy nostalgia seems to be its sole purpose.
0," An odd kind of a slog that manages to keep you partially engaged, even at its most esoteric or absurd, despite an endlessly excitable choir and Hans Zimmer's pitiless score."
1," The subject and the film clips are great, although the documentary as a whole is a bit gimmicky."
0," At times, it actually hurts to watch."
0," Confusing, jumbled, and idiotic, and then it turns stupid."
0, There's little reason here for further misadventures.
0," Imagine the elaborate plan: 'We use the sets left over from Red Riding Hood, add a candy house, throw in some aerial forest shots out of Twilight, keep it cheap. Steampunk it up, and have 'em wear leather, 'specially her. Lotsa cleavage.'"
0, Check it out if you like the horror genre. It was not bad at all.
0," Stars Matthew Perry and Elizabeth Hurley illicit more than a chuckle, and more jokes land than crash, but ultimately Serving Sara doesn't distinguish itself from the herd."
0," Pleasant, if mediocre family fare."
1," If Kormákur's goal was to replicate the chaos of that day, he's succeeded...impresses more with its technical achievements than its storytelling."
0, Nothing about Namaste England is redeemable. This is 135 minutes of mediocrity that you would do well to avoid.
1," If its argument is flawed, then at least it's an argument worth making."
0," Be it dead serious, moronic racecar driver Ricky Bobby or idiotic, deadpan Ron Burgandy, Ferrell has managed to create quite the niche for himself as the honest, earnest moron."
1," ...a wholly unique piece, a contemporized take on Dahl's 1970 book with as much interpersonal angst as kid-friendly fun."
1," Although well-crafted but improbable action set pieces cast Neeson as an essentially indomitable force, the film's emotional force rests on the comparatively persuasive setup."
1, Andre the Giant is a fantastic documentary.
1," In the hands of less capable filmmakers this quirky fish tale might have sunk itself, but Murray and Anderson manage to reel it in."
1, The most exciting film about journalism and the media since All the President's Men (1976).
1," Though their selfishness is repellent, the characters feel strikingly real."
0," See it if you like films which start off slow, have plenty of scenes in the dark, a few good battle sequences and incomprehensible men talking bunk."
1, the Most Meaningful of all the John Hughes teen movies
0," A rancid, insulting, and cynical dramedy about a man who travels around the world to reconnect with his soul."
0, A pretty good idea for a movie that is not particularly well executed.
1, shamelessly embracing the violence and twisted elements that make for an R-rated film
0,"Fellow critics, just because a film purports political views doesn't make them any less non-sensical."
0," Fanning, Dunst and the on-a-roll Kidman all seem ready to dive in, but ""The Beguiled"" stops them short. There's plenty of cunning boiling beneath the surface, but Coppola keeps a tight lid on it."
0, Here's the good news: the latest toy from George Lucas's soulless Star Wars factory is better than The Phantom Menace. Now the bad: it's not much better.
0," An ignorant, false, bigoted, boring, pretentious film that could have been made by Eisenstein in the Kremlin under Joseph Stalin in 1938."
0, too down to earth
0, The only upside here is the acting... The rest is an irredeemable mess.
0," If you're looking for anything other than a parody clipshow, you won't find it."
1, A gritty science-fiction film that features a population of humanoid crustacean-alien creatures [that] is far more grounded in reality than any of the current rom-coms currently unspooling in your neighbourhood multiplex.
0," The shot of Blart quietly crawling into a hostage situation inside the mall's bank and walking through a roped line is a moment of absurd grace, only it's shot with the vulgarity of a Crash Test Dummies commercial."
1," Horror allows Thelma to work with the history queer people have been dealt; the genre never requests an apology for yesterday's transgressions, but it might seek reparations by giving the viewer a few spooks."
0," Given its title, you'd expect the picture to be a lot of fun. The most surprising thing about it is that you'd be wrong. "
1," The McDonald's hamburger of action movies. Well, maybe that's not entirely fair. Maybe the Wendy's."
0, A clawless cross-breed of comic book movie cliches.
0," An instant cult movie, and while it certainly succeeds on that level and members of the cult will embrace it for that very reason, the uninitiated--though impressed by its style--will probably be more exhausted than delighted."
1," There's no denying that Solo: A Star Wars Story is, for the most part, an absolute blast."
1,"Middle Men spins one heck of a yarn, so crazy it must be true. "
1," Sentimental, disarming, if, also, at times, a little manipulative with on-the-nose moments, ""Dumplin'"" is everything that ""Insatiable"" should have been."
1," You can guess where things are leading, but only to a point. Fogelman tosses in some mild surprises along the way, some more effective than others."
0," Director Daniel Stamm manages one memorable set piece, involving a motorcycle gang and a clothes line."
1, Lots of fun stuff in this kiddie-pleasing film full of appealing characters... A good story jarred by frenetic pacing
0, Well-meaning but predictable ...
1," Slattery's flick depicts its close-knit, blue-collar community with economy and insight."
0," The strong chemistry between Brie and Sudeikis makes this feel more cohesive than it actually is, but without a consistent tone underlying the jokes, it's hard to know how to react."
0," John Frankenheimer's Black Sunday did not convince or move me, even in its occasional tense moments."
1, Serious cinema of the globalist sort.
0, Zoolander 2 fails because they remove the characters out of the fashion world setting and into a spy parody that would make Austin Powers cringe. 
1," It's a crazy, unfathomable question. It's about faith."
1,"In Payne films, as in the films of Jean Renoir, there are no ""goodies"" or ""baddies""; everyone has their reasons, and that makes his work distinctly different from most mainstream American films these days."
1, Shenk's film is close enough to his subject to catch the leader who rails against carbon-dioxide emissions puffing on cigarettes in parking lots.
0, A highlight reel of gunfire and explosions masquerading as a political thriller ...
1, Ranks among the best films of the year.
0, It has impeccable production values but feels like a Masterpiece Theater production of a Harlequin romance novel.
0," Crass and vulgar, of course. It's supposed to be funny, too, but it isn't...It makes a movie like 'Superbad'...seem like Shakespeare."
1," As sublimely warming an experience as the autumn sun that shines benevolently on the vineyard owned by the film's central character, Magali."
1," Without a doubt a disconcertingly engrossing, difficult-to-shake experience."
1,"There are in fact no bad performances in this picture. The events depicted are often ugly and sometimes repulsive, but Cassavetes never flinches from depicting them fully"
1," Maruge and Obinchu never lose their senses of humor or conviction, and Litondo and Harris are ideally cast."
1," Jane Campion has been a favorite of mine for sometime with original, strong, and daring films."
1," My Brother Is an Only Child is a buoyant, handsomely crafted film."
1, [Thomas Jane] delivers a gritty performance that's entirely believable...
1," There's nothing terribly surprising about this movie's dramatic arc, but it's nicely executed, and Ferrell's restrained, almost gentle performance is a revelation."
1, One of The Asphalt Jungle's strengths is that the crims seem about as thick as you suspect they would be in real life: no Cruise or Clooney-style braniac super-athletes here.
1," Nowhere in Africa is a movie of many moods and nuances. In addition to being a Holocaust saga, it's a girl's story, a woman's story and the story of a marriage."
0, The human drama is cut short in favor of all the battle scenes... they should have thrown this lame Christian script to the lions and made another Gladiator.
0," Although Canopy is far from the worst Australian film ever made, there will be few that will be as tedious. "
0," ""Ray"" starts out well... and then falls into the entrenched paths of just about every other overwrought, over-long musical biopic ever filmed."
0, Too many of its moments of let's-subvert-the-genre seem to leave McDonagh stranded and flailing at just the moment when a Tarantino movie or a Chuck Palahniuk novel is snapping into place.
0, The film settles into a Forrest Gumpian groove that doesn't glorify the human spirit so much as sap it.
1," It's escapism - the world would be a lot safer if good and evil were so clearly defined - and it's something that Mel Gibson proves (once again) that he does very, very well in Apocalypto."
1," With Efron providing the shark's smile, ""Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"" becomes a cutting commentary on the slippery nature of evil."
0," If only By the Sea were hilariously bad, I could recommend it for star power alone. But this is a film stuck in the doldrums."
0,One of those releases that really should have gone straight to video -- in the discount bin.
1," Forbidden romance on a deserted, cold, and rainy island? Sign me up."
0, Third rate Jason Bourne effort with one-note turn by Dylan O'Brien.
1," With a ton of heart, sentimentality, and a huge emphasis on friendship, The World's End puts a spin on the imperfections all humans have and delivers a film that is near perfect because of it."
1," Its relatively conventional approach (including a recurring musical theme!) doesn't obscure the beautiful, enigmatic tone that's long set Tsai apart."
1," The characters are so closely observed and played with such exacting accuracy and conviction that Bubble becomes quietly, inexorably, hypnotic."
1," Believe it or not, no one ever says the game's signature line. So, lets say it here, all together and with enthusiasm, ""You sunk my Battleship!"" "
0, Shyamalan extends a decent 30 minute Twilight Zone episode into a two hour endurance test
0," All the narrative's blank spaces, previously well-guarded by editor Julia Gregory, collapse into a fudged finale of stuttering irresolution."
0, Margot at the Wedding provides ample evidence of just how low Noah Baumbach has sunk.
0, More loud silliness. 
0," Doesn't crash and burn, but it doesn't exactly sail across the finish line a winner, either."
1," The script has just enough ideas, however bluntly expressed, to lift it from the eye-candy pack."
1," Whilst lacking the impact and imagination of The Act of Killing, there is a simmering tension and beating emotional heart that makes this movie every bit as necessary."
1, The talented cast elevates a decidedly average plot to one that is worth catching.
1, What could have been merely a feel-good exercise in Eschatology Lite instead becomes a wholesome but also surprisingly tough-minded portrait of a man wrestling with his faith.
0," For adults, there's little to recommend here."
1, The Queen is an unqualified triumph that works on all levels.
0," Carell is charming as the nerd spy who wants to fight and there are goofy moments, even if the film struggles to maintain balance between its comedic and action elements, between paying homage to the iconic TV show and bringing a fresh contemporary angle"
1," It's powerfully crafted, intensely paced and brilliantly acted from all involved players, and a film that's easily [Lumet's] best since Network."
0, Is aimed squarely at everyone who loved Good Will Hunting...it's the same only different -- the very definition of formula fiction.
1,"The funny and powerfully weird Rango is probably the closest I've seen a big-budget, computer-animated feature get to the comic vibe of my favorite Chuck Jones cartoons."
0, W. might have had some impact had it been made four years ago. But it's both too late and too early for a movie about our sitting president.
0," Duck Butter is a chance to witness the entire arc of a troubled relationship play out in 24 hours, but much like the endeavor itself, it sounds more appealing than it turns out to be."
0," Lacks the focus necessary to hold its audience, eventually becoming mired in a convoluted plot and comedic bits that are as scattershot as a Florida vote count."
0," Too much chatting, not enough chills."
1," Foul-mouthed and funny, 'Going the Distance' is a youthful romance for grownups."
1," Once viewers get past the obligatory raunch (a necessary salute, I suppose, to such atrocious '80s comedies as Private School and Porky's Revenge), they might be surprised to discover the level of genuine wit on display."
0," Most people won't care enough about these people or believe in their relationships to sit out all 115 minutes of this icily mannered film that continually hints at darker, more subversive themes of sado-masochism than it dares to explore."
0," Fifty years after her death, the actress's corpse is still being picked over with ever-diminishing returns, as evidenced in Liz Garbus's garish, misguided documentary Love, Marilyn."
1, [Director] Mélanie Laurent does not stay far from the American Southern noir. [Full review in Spanish]
1,"The film moves into psychedelic and violent territory, creating a perspective that is equally unreal and unforgettable."
1," A portrait of a narcissistic poet, Softness of Bodies will most likely appeal to the viewer who can identify with the 'struggling artist' existence."
0," Unfortunate thesps take it all very seriously, while technical aspects are emptily polished."
0, Lady in the Water exposes Hollywood's master of suspense as a wet noodle.
0," A disappointing, improbable political melodrama from a good director"
0," There's a more considered debate to be had about the historical, legal, and political precedents of the events in The Conspirator."
1," It's a documentary that for about one minute seems as though it's going to be as fey and quirky as its title. But far from a jolly little film about odd, harmless people, it's dark, weird and menacing."
1, A wonderfully lively and engrossing movie ...
0, Galifianakis is one of the funniest people on the planet. To put him in a movie and have him recite unfunny lines is like driving a Porsche in the slow lane and never shifting out of first gear.
1," Tender, thoughtful and complex."
0, Suffers from a poorly written and executed script as well as horrific dialogue and direction.
0," And with Jet Li or Jean Reno nowhere to be found, what's the point of bringing Yuen and Besson together at last?"
1," The backroom deals and dirty tricks represent politics as they are, not as they should be. This is a deeply cynical movie and, in that cynicism, it finds truth."
0," Comedy is here, but not always a priority to Hill, who's aiming for more of a character study than a laugh riot, and this picture doesn't benefit from a general muting of silliness."
0, The city's saviour is transformed too easily into a horrible person.
1, An engaging thriller that should thoroughly satisfy genre fans during a time of year when their choices are essentially between bad and worse.
0, You have to admit it is not half as horrendous as some of his other movies. 
0," Spurlock neither conveys the appeal of this world, nor does he ever, for one minute, stand outside the phenomenon and objectively examine it."
1," Michael B. Jordan portrays Oscar Grant as a complex and real person, making Fruitvale Station more than just the story of a death. In fact, it's one full of life."
1,The Southern-Gothic-lite tapestry Rapp builds allows Altman to do some of his most nuanced storytelling.
0," Sandler's abysmal script cooks up a bite-sized moral for the finale. Groan ups, more like."
0," All the squealing tires, flying bullets and falling bodies cannot save Heat from drowning in its own banalities."
0," Pfister's experience shows in that the film is beautifully arranged; unfortunately, that's the best thing about it."
1,"Director Sofia Coppola's second feature film is so smart and, yet, simple that it is nearly perfect."
1, There's not one weak link in the portrayals of this train-wreck of a family. 
0, Can a mediocre movie be made worthwhile by a single performance?
1,Deeper than mere mimicry...
1," Like the old-timey music that inspired it, Down From the Mountain is sweet, serene and utterly unconcerned with polish."
1, The true story of a selfish Polish man whose caring for a band of Jew living underground in sewers during World War II qualifies him for recognition as a Righteous Gentile.
0," Okja takes the worst impulses of Walt Disney, Wes Anderson, Tim Burton and Michael Moore and rolls them into one movie. "
1, The audience is rocked back and forth in sympathy. . . in a tangled predicament. [N]one is one-dimensional in the superb ensemble [as] the point of view changes by minutes.
1," Sweet without being overbearing, boasting delectable visuals and a strong pair of lead performances, Adam is much better than what it could have been but still not quite a home run."
1, The film is entertaining whenever it isn't trying to make the audience sob.
1," Known for distinctive horror movies like Cure and Pulse, inventive Japanese filmmaker Kiyoshi Kurosawa finds just the right melancholy tone to suit a new and all too familiar kind of horror: economic downsizing."
1," Roland Emmerich's best film, and Lundgren's best acting job. Admittedly that ain't saying much in either case, but a fun flick all in all."
1, [Children of Men] is terribly exciting.
0," It's an earnest, timely(TM), important(TM), awards-season(TM) prestige picture(TM)..."
0," In one scene Mark revisits his celebrated ""Choose Life"" monologue and revs up a new one-but he comes across like a scold now, taking jabs at cellphones and social media. Suddenly T2 sounds like somebody's parent."
0,In reality Man Of The Year is one half The Robin Williams Show and one half dour thriller involving a rigged election and the evils of electronic voting machines. The second half nearly obliterates the film.
1, The Graduate gives some substance to the contention that American films are coming of age -- of our age.
1," ""The Martian"" is exactly what you expect it to be: tense, humorous and dramatic."
1," An intimate study in the loss of innocence. Just as Somersault launched Abbie Cornish's career, Lore will no doubt do the same for lovely German newcomer Saskia Rosendahl, whose sensitive and poignant performance captures every complexity"
0," This film is skillfully made, expertly directed, well acted, and pretty distasteful to me."
1," A spirited and ripping sci-fi yarn that works every bit as well as that first one -- and, at least on one level, even better. "
1," One of the year's best films, a bubbly meditation on family and responsibility that weighs just enough to matter."
1," Oh my God, I can't believe how good X-Men: First Class is. It's so good, I held my pee for at least 90 minutes because I didn't want to miss anything. "
1," Living in an age where we all have a computer at our fingertips leaves little margin for error, yet somehow we still elected a man who did far worse than Gary Hart which makes The Front Runner right on time."
0,"Everyone connected with this gangsta opus was probably trying to make a crowd-pleaser. However, you wind up wondering what kind of crowds they were trying to please."
0," It's a wearyingly familiar story -- and even the jokes, mostly insect puns, aren't the kind that adults are likely to enjoy. "
1," ""Timothy Spall grunts and grumbles his way through the film, chewing the scenery and spitting it back out with contempt."""
0," Much like the first movie, The Smurfs 2 is exclusively filled with humor targeted at the very youngest members of the audience, leaving grown-ups no option other than to cover their faces with their palms and shake their heads."
0, Beneath the considerable eye candy ... The Cell is an awfully generic variation on the overworked serial-killer genre.
0," By trying to remain romantic comedy audience-friendly, it just purees the whole thing into a stew no one would want to eat."
1," While Fogelman's script is extremely calculated and heavy-handed, the cast's nimble execution turns it into an agreeeable way to pass the time."
1," ""Gloria Bell"" wavers between realistic drama and tender comedy, which makes for an uneven but never uninteresting mix."
0, A desperate grab to seem relevant and profound
0," Talent is involved everywhere in Derailed, and it all gets trashed in the final reel for the sake of teasing and then appeasing a bored November audience."
0, Mediocrity should never be encouraged.
1," ""As fine-tuned and moving a performance as Cumberbatch delivers - all the more impressive for being created from scratch, since no audio or video recordings of Turing exist - the film's Turing suffers an acute lack of an inner life."""
1, A handful of very strong performances keep redeeming the film just when it seems as if it's going to become intolerable.
1,"A film that managed to terrify a generation of children one minute, leave them eager to hunt for fossils in their backyard the next. "
0," Terrence Howard nearly saves the latest widget from the inspirational sports movie mill, a movie heavy on cliches and light on truth."
1," A deconstructionist take on the teenaged coming-of-age story, director Patricia Riggen's fair adaptation of Hiram Martinez's screenplay makes bold commentary on immigrant culture and values in America."
1, Director Catherine Hardwicke grew up in the area where the Zephyr team lived and she gets the look and feel of it just right.
0," Sex, ice, and rock and roll repeat over and over in this short but still very slow story of an doomed and very sexual romance."
1," It's getting hard to feel empathetic for people who live in future dystopian societies. Oh, boo hoo, your peaceful government collapsed and ... you are grouped by how handy you happen to be at some particular task. You know, we all have problems."
0," Billy Elliot almost always makes the wrong choice, for the saccharine over the convincing."
1," Astonishing. Achieves its grotesque, magnificent brutality in an old-fashioned way that serves as a smackdown to bloated, sterile CGI monstrosities."
0," The Legend of Hercules may not track, but Harlin still knows how to set up a rousing circus."
1,"The Infiltrator is a true-crime story, familiar but compelling, about false identities, affording Cranston the chance to play a man who is pretending to be another, more swaggering, more dangerous man."
1, 20th Century Women isn't a perfect film -- some of the changes in perspective are a little jarring and the resolution feels rushed. But Mills has a keen eye for observational detail and the world he creates feels authentic.
0, Pretty mediocre fare.
1," It's a demanding, high-brow watch, yet ably conveys the rootlessness and dislocation of the immigrant experience."
0," Yup. Marvel actually made Sony release a whole movie about the hero of their ""their"" superhero franchise begging Robert Downey Jr. to please, pretty-please, let him be in more of the Avengers movies."
0," Overall more thoughtful than jingoistic, even if it does little to advance audience understanding of the War on Terror and its multi-tentacled morality plays."
0, All the unpredictability of professional wrestling plus the magic of synchronized Stairmasters -- that's what I got out of the vaunted spectacle of Pacific Rim.
0," Mainly, Shyamalan's spookfest suffers from an acute case of monotony. "
1, I don't know about you but these are my kind of meta-humans.
1,"A film of integrity and disclosure, a controversial chapter in American history that substitutes clinical accuracy for Hollywood embellishment, with an impressive attention to detail and an admirable respect for suspenseful narrative."
1," with teenagers, there will always come a time when innocence must be lost - but Levine's film transfixes this moment with the sharpness of a razor."
0," A grim, shrill, deluded and incredibly depressing movie, so bewilderingly mean-spirited that the trademark Farrelly Brothers gross-out scenes feel like the sweetest."
1," ""Hugo"" is a movie that children will enjoy, adults will admire and film buffs will cheer. It is a movie that will surprise and delight you with its wonder and awe."
0," ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" is a lackluster story filled with mesmerizing special effects."
0," Heinzerling chooses to focus on the couple and their art, but it unfolds too slowly and at times it feels like the film has a lack of focus, altering between showing us their art creations and their rocky relationship without a balance. "
0, The film is too tepid in its treatment of its central character and her situation to generate any real emotive charge.
0," Last Flag Flying lacks the casual, lived-in realism you usually find in a Linklater film. You don't buy the men as long-separated pals, and so you don't really buy the premise the connection that caused Doc to seek out these men is not visible on screen."
0, more one liners than schwarzenegger could dream off
1,"A fun, amusing, will-they-or-won't-they confection -- a love rhombus wherein a hastily married couple grapples with mutually wandering eyes."
0, Universal's Dark Universe franchise stumbles badly in its first installment. The Mummy is a bloated spectacle with a weak script and terrible performances.
0," It's all watchable, but in the way of a rainy Saturday afternoon Law & Order marathon, even with Kruger wrestling to invest scenes of her snorting and free-basing her pain away with emotional authenticity."
0, The original Omen spawned two sequels. This lifeless remake guarantees we'll be spared the run-up to Armageddon.
1," Julie Taymor has created a film that is as vulgar, obvious and glorious as the Shakespeare play it's based on."
0," A forced, implausible flick that loses its energy as it tries to gain momentum."
0," A movie that lacks the jazz hand energy of Glee, but packs good-natured laughs to keep someone awake for its two hour duration. More ""noise"" than ""joyful."""
1,John Moore's remake doesn't come close to upstaging its predecessor...and yet it doesn't exactly humiliate itself either.
0," D'Arcy and Harper excel and there's the odd punch packed, but otherwise it's an identity parade of prison clichés you've seen a thousand times."
1," Hawk and Delpy know just how to get under your skin. Their onscreen alter egos fit like a glove, and witnessing their ageing, nagging, toying love is a true privilege."
1,"Along with CLERKS, it makes a nice bookend to [Kevin] Smith's Jersey chronicles"
0," Aspires to be funny, poignant and inspirational, but real emotion seldom penetrates its sticky sugar coating."
0, Takes a good 90 minutes before it delivers us from dullness
1," A Brilliant Young Mind is an inoffensive film, looking to please a broad audience and while it achieves its goals, there's always a sense that it could have done more..."
1," Sotomayor's vivid compositions establish environments and spaces tellingly, hinting at the family's history and current state through minor details and gestures, suggesting the bigger picture without ever explaining it."
0," Proyas remains a skilled director of mood and spectacle, but a striking look and a handful of remarkable setpieces -- look out for that plane -- can't elevate what's ultimately a silly movie with a queasy subtext."
0," Cheap-looking, gore-drenched and so postmodern and self-consciously above it all that it's hard to care about anyone's fate, Feast is sort of a mean-spirited variation on the vastly superior Tremors."
0, A completely pointless adaptation.
0," Before adding to the pre-existing heap of critical disdain for Peter Jackson's take on Alice Sebold's much-adored 2002 novel, is it possible to admit the book might have been a tad overrated?"
0, I walked out of this movie tired.
0, Patricia Clarkson's Juliette comes off as so hopelessly naïve that the characterization grates in its lack of credibility.
1," The House of Magic is a simple, yet entertaining enough, animated feature."
0," Like the pseudo biopic on Mandela, the rugby half is both shallow and generic, qualities echoed by the horrendously mawkish theme song 'Colorblind' that is enough to make Invictus seem like a parody of an inspirational film."
1,"Bill Murray is perfectly cast and his performance is understated, like the entire film. He deserves an Oscar nomination."
1,"As Leslie Cockburn's camera roams the foreclosed rowhouses of Baltimore, their planked-up doors reminiscent of shots from The Wire, I thought: Baltimore needs some good PR."
0, Taking offense to a film about tolerance just because it's aimed squarely at Middle America is itself intolerant. Chuck and Larry's crime is it doesn't maintain its most audacious bits and it's never funny enough.
0," Anderson's films tend to inspire coffee-table books. This one is a coffee-table book, fun to flip through or dip into but not ideal for reading from cover to cover."
0," Truly, it's hard to care that much about these bad people, or the lightning-belching cloud of debris swirling above Midway, or whether Jared Leto's Joker is disturbing or distracting."
1," Unfriended uses everyday audio and visual screen iconography, which take on a whole new chilling dimension and whacks up suspense levels tenfold."
0," Bad Boys II is enough to make a young person feel old, and an old person stop going to the movies."
1," ... it's simply the classic battle of Family Man vs. Freak Show, and it is 100% one of the funniest films of the last year."
1, Can Harry piece together the clues? And can he use his magical superstar status for more than just free butterbeers?
0," Joe has just about everything right on the surface, but without anything for the audience to get engaged with, it merely results in an empty film and a waste of two hours."
0," When it's not getting bogged down in cliches, I Am Number Four is decent fun, even if it does feel very familiar and ultimately forgettable."
0," You watch ""Country Strong"" wishing you were watching ""Crazy Heart,"" and wondering whether Gwyneth Paltrow read the script all the way through, and wishing Bridges would turn up to show the folks how it's done."
1, You don't need a keen interest in history to be swept up in the deeply poignant delivery of Yoji Yamada's unmistakable anti-war message.
0," Sets the table for an engaging film, but it never amounts to enough to be fully satisfying."
0," Simplistic and filled with characters who, however well they may have been developed on the page, have little depth onscreen."
1," Though The General (1927) is still considered Keaton's masterpiece, Steamboat Bill Jr. is gaining considerable momentum."
1," It isn't important how many dragons DeBlois crams into a movie. It's how many figurative dragons, breathing sameness into animation, he'll continue to slay."
1, Tully is a serendipitous treasure.
0, A righteous exercise. It just could be a better righteous exercise.
0," Non-super things made super isn't a new aesthetic, but it's at its most shameless in Robin Hood, superimposing raw essential parts stolen from Batman's background upon its source material."
1, ...might just be the most puerile mainstream movie ever made...
0," This is a predictable, drawn-out disappointment."
0," Instead of being trapped in one bedroom, this family has quite a few escape routes that they use quite a bit, which doesn't really help build a sense of dread. It just makes you think, ""Get out of the house, fools. The door's right there."""
0," Zwick's Once and Again and thirtysomething portrayed emotion more honestly than many TV shows of their time. But in Love and Other Drugs, he unevenly weds the satirical and the sentimental."
1," The performances, appearing as they do in an intimate, elegant drama of love, separation and loyalty, are so affecting and so devoted to the characters in the most unselfish ways. "
1, Zombie looks beyond the horror genre for influence and creates a film that doesn't exactly shatter expectations but at least sidesteps them with some degree of verve.
0, Whose bright idea was this?
1,"Improbable as it sounds in such a brutal protagonist, Aileen has a three-dimensional credibility."
1," History is used as a backdrop to the main event, being the relationships of Emily Blunt's Victoria. Blunt is lovely, delivering just the right mix of feisty, vulnerable and stubborn to engage us in her conflicted, manipulated world"
0, A Clockwork Orange as imagined by a Commodore64. 
0," Over-stuffed and under-conceived, Fist Fight is a clumsy mélange of clashing comedic perspectives."
0,"The actors are fine, but the material doesn't give their talents much room to stretch."
1, I don't scare easily. This one freaked me out. 
1, The Craft casts a relatively potent spell.
0, Fassbender's performance as Magneto makes me feel how I wanted to feel about Anakin in any of the Star Wars prequels.
1," If you don't mind bloodshed and are drawn to taut thrillers with fascinating characters portrayed skillfully, Eastern Promises is just the ticket."
0, It ends up feeling a little like warmed-over Strictly Ballroom without Baz Lurhmann's over-the-top sense of style.
0," As Spanglish caroms from sitcom-cute comedy to heavy emotional crisis and back again, we can't understand why a nice guy like John would marry a hopeless harpy like Deborah in the first place."
1," Gripping, shocking, and ultimately very moving, a true equal to Downfall."
0," A mystery film that involves videotapes, blackmail, seduction games and assassinations. In his ambition to create a noir film, director Brian DeCubellis fails in his attempt and only offers an incoherent story. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, Neither the story nor characters have any moral ambiguity or psychological shadings.
0, The Kingdom isn't evil - it's just stupid.
1," Every trope, twist, and trick of the genre is up for skewering in the comedy, but the film keeps things light and smart, never dipping into darkness or crass jokes."
1," The movie leaves behind a profound afterthought, a feeling that we have just been roused by an idea that has not yet been spoken or discovered."
1," Upstream Color is something else: a genuine, lasting mystery."
0, Pointless Pirates
0, Exploitation remake delivers sadism and gore but little else.
1," Nothing here will surprise you -- which is, really, as it should be. Segel, serving as co-writer, and director James Bobin have, with a knowing wink, mined the old-time Muppet charm and humor, and they have hit paydirt."
0," Unfortunately, in between bouts of high-speed action there's a dud story about nasty mercenaries driving around Europe stealing military equipment."
0, A dull 1977 would-be chiller. 
0," Some of it is is truly, unmissably great. Some of it is hilariously awful, and some of it is awful enough to not even crawl up to the level of hilarity"
1, Damn if the sublime last act doesn't wash away most of the movie's early and clumsy aftertaste. 
1," Happy Endings begins with what seems quite an unhappy ending, when Mamie (Lisa Kudrow) is hit by a car."
1,A dark comedy teens will love.
0, No Good Deed is an example of the worst kind of exploitative thriller.
0," The overriding feeling is of a film school degree show: good intentions and the odd impressive moment, but little that ultimately delivers."
0," Ends up as something I could only watch just one day and never again. (Full Content Review for Parents - Profanity, Sexual Content, etc. - also Available)"
1," This persuasive paean to sheer bloody-minded persistence flies by over the course of 136 engrossing, often hilarious minutes."
1," Stunningly designed and superbly written, this is an exciting, enjoyable and intelligent blockbuster with a terrific central performance from Jennifer Lawrence."
0," A rancid pseudo ""girl power"" film about women who think it's just the greatest thing ever to learn they've all been cheated on by the same guy. "
1," Shin Godzilla is a success, blending bureaucratic detail with monstrous mayhem into one exciting package, with enough nods to the original and more than enough originality to let it stand and destroy Tokyo on its own."
1," In its best moments, the film's mix of naivete and audacious imagination projects a primitive dream state -- a quality that more-knowing cinema of later decades could never achieve."
1, Scorsese's magnum opus 'til Kundun came along.
0,"Not only are the bees nonsensical, so is the plot, even grading on the fantasy curve."
1,It's impossible to tell the experienced from the inexperienced among Loach's casts.
0,"MacFarlane has been allowed to run rampant with his racism, gun violence and ill-will towards women for far too long."
1, An inspiring story of compassion and service in a program training rape victims to be community leaders. 
0," Guillermo del Toro doesn't rise above the obligations of staging a film of this sort as a multi-level video game, a stylish but programmatic ride toward an inevitable final boss battle."
1," A film that has a strong message that fits perfectly to our times, and that everybody will enjoy. [Full review in Spanish]"
1," You cannot help being stirred by the reach and depth, the constant rebuffs to sloppiness, of a strong ensemble."
1," If it's not the new Rocky Horror Picture Show, it comes pretty damned close."
1," The Visit is good. It lacks the flashiness and giant twists Shyamalan is known for, and this is a big plus for the film. "
0," As an exercise in ""re-imagining,"" to use Hollywood's favorite rehash euphemism, this Nightmare is mostly stale goods."
1," As Tim Burton films go, ""Frankenweenie"" is as visually keyed-in as any."
0, So meaningless and distanced in its details that it hardly stands a chance of wooing even the most willing fellow traveler.
1," In & Out doesn't take itself seriously for a moment, which is why the halcyon-happy schmaltz that floats through the movie and floods the last reel is forgivable."
1," Widows is filled with wild beauty, heart-thumping grotesquerie and even some good ol' soapy treachery."
1," Deliriously inventive but dramatically empty, Micmacs is like watching a talented kid who doesn't know when to stop showing off"
1," Brett Dalton is the reason to see the film. He manages to combine brashness, cockiness and charm in a winning performance."
0," The Man Who Wasn't There denatures pulp, and although I know this was the Coens' intention, it's not a particularly gratifying one. Their movie isn't there, either."
0," Great stars can't rescue uneven, sometimes violent comedy."
1," A grand and glorious film that may well be the smash hit of 1977, and certainly is the best movie of the year so far."
1, Both deeply touching and aesthetically powerful.
1,A pulp classic with a crackerjack ending.
1," For all the high dudgeon with which the movie has been anticipated, it turns out that Ghostbusters -- like the girls who cheerfully dominate it this time around -- just wants to have fun. And it does."
0," The problem remains, however, that Scoop feels so drawn out and lackadaisical in its bid for self-deprecating Allen-esque bits that wear out its familiar welcome."
1," Soderbergh raises clumsy and absurd moments to keep the mood, wrapped in country-style musical atmospheres like John Denver and Creedence Clearwater Revival. [Full review in Spanish]"
1, The Citizen Kane of killer piranha movies.
1, An inventive original and leads to some stunning transformations and suspenseful sequences. Benson and Moorhead know how to manipulate the audience in a fun way. It's okay. You can trust them to take you on a good ride.
1," A delicate heartbreaker about friendship, desire and the occasionally blurred line between the two."
1," For as over the top as [Woo's] shootouts tend to be, the ones in The Killer are some of his most excessive."
0, A Blumhouse addition that's so boring it may induce bouts of narcolepsy.
1, Buffalo Boys romps through familiar 'birth of a legend' territory with moderately entertaining results.
1, There's easily eight to 10 films this year that didn't deserve their blockbuster financing and distribution. Then there's films like this that show how to do more with less. 
0," None of this is good, per se, but that doesn't prevent it from being entertaining in a madcap sort of way."
0," Despite an energetic portrayal by Law, his character is so obnoxious that any emotional connection seems impossible."
0," Hart's shtick - he talks smack, his challenger reacts, he tries to hide - is already beginning to show signs of almost being tired, or at least in need of a change-up."
0," With the corpse of a nightmare called Knight of Cups, I have finally given up on Terrence Malick. This dog of a film is as riveting and fascinating as a walk-in bathtub."
1," Studio comedies have been so bad for so long that when a halfway decent one comes along, we critics tend to get overexcited. But Game Night is a little better than decent, and handles its commendably silly premise with real skill and charm."
1," What starts out as a hodgepodge of Pulp Fiction, Trainspotting and Reservoir Dogs slowly becomes as enjoyable and visually stylish as the films from which Lock, Stock draws its comparisons."
1, ... a classical Western that invites us to savor no-nonsense camaraderie between two shootists for hire.
1, Exposing humans to the rich ecosystem that produced and sustains all life makes Oceans inherently valuable.
1, There's something particularly delightful -- and subversive -- about a high-concept comedy that turns into something resonant.
0," Alas, the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick."
1," 'My next project is to motion capture some hair and comb it over my 3D scalp,' said Zemeckis."
1,"While Russell's movie doesn't quite capture the freewheeling dementia of [Charlie] Kaufman's output, it's still a noteworthy effort."
0, A work of noble intentions that's aesthetically slight and low in contextual carbs and righteous indignation.
0," Even without the pre-title announcement that this romantic comedy is writer-director Patrik-Ian Polk's first film, it's pretty obvious that we're in the hands of a beginner."
0," Directors Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo lay on visual style as thick as the corn syrup used for their buckets of fake blood while Lili Taylor and Stephen Dorff try in vain to lend dignity to the film's lousy, anemic premise."
0, It never gets fun. It's a dull ride for me. It actually felt like I was a commuter on a train. 
1," Made up of hearty but meaningless laughs in a script of breezy, frothy spunk."
1," Brittle Chandler characters have been transferred to the screen with punch by Howard Hawks' production and direction, providing full load of rough, tense action most of the way."
0," Jurassic World is not like having your eye poked out with a stick. It is loaded to the gills with Stuff. But the summer analogy is San Andreas, not Max Max: Fury Road."
0, The Magnificent Seven is an awkward milestone in Hollywood's ongoing and urgent conversation about representation. 
0," Padilha's Hollywood debut is craftsmanlike and respectable, which is perhaps not what an updated retelling of Verhoeven's grimy, gritty, gory classic deserved."
1, Director Taika Waititi's Marvel debut bursts at the seams with creative pleasure that communicates the same sense of fun that was clearly present on set.
1," Sweet Country is a gorgeous and scathing revisionist western, but one that doesn't entirely trust its audience."
1," A mild lark disguised as a wild bender, ""The Rum Diary"" is also a touching tribute to Thompson himself, who committed suicide in 2005."
1, Gere and Roberts evidence enough genuine chemistry on the screen to fill a dozen run-of-the-mill romances.
1," Bohdanowicz undertook the project without having previously met her subject, but for both the filmmaker and her audience, making Sellam's acquaintance proves a rare pleasure."
1, His best film for years.
1," Deliciously witty, visually gorgeous and frequently unsettling in its melding of the comic and the chilling, The Favourite is one of the best films of the year."
0, Surely a better title would have been 'Saturday'.
1, One of the best Christmas horror movies I've seen.
1," A high-spirited bauble that goes down easy thanks to fleet comic pacing, a surfeit of ravishing Cote d'Azur vistas and the genuinely reactive chemistry of stars Colin Firth and Emma Stone."
0," Another disappointingly derivative imitation of The Blair Witch Project, this time mashed up with The X-Files franchise."
1," It's a graceful, engaging film -- I enjoyed it. But it could have been called The Tasteful Dozen."
0, It's not worth the bother.
0, Hurt and Dance share a wonderful rapport and one can't help but wish That Good Night had been a two-hander.
0, It's one picturesque disaster after another.
0,"in its pleasantly low-key way, this is as inconsequential and instantly forgettable a movie as a bombastic blockbuster like Transformers: Dark of the Moon."
0, Raunchy musical numbers and demeaning stereotypes overwhelm the film's feeble attempts at social satire about censorship and cultural diversity.
0," Most of the movie has the cruddy lighting and generic, death-by-franchise atmosphere of a third-rate spectacle that's been worked over by too many hacks."
1," With Kid Gorgeous, Mulaney continues to be consistent as both a writer and performer."
0," Crystal's then-hegemonic stardom constantly realigns the film into his, not his character's, orbit. "
1," At times, the film's evocation of war's absurdities invokes memories of Robert Altman's M*A*S*H."
0," A postmodern splish-splash, this film ziplines here, there, everywhere. The movie's feel skids from circus-tent carnivalesque to amusement-park giddiness. Never boring, Pan's also never sure what it wants to be."
1,Fun without too much camp.
0, How do you make mutants dull?
0," The movie wants to have it both ways and, as a result, manages to contradict itself at almost every turn, never finding its own way."
1,"The set-up is slow and weak, but once it gets rolling, it works pretty well."
0," Beyond the contrivance and a gimmicky story that not only would never happen but would never happen in the way it happens here, there are positive aspects to ""The Last Word."""
0," Gritty, grimdark Bond may have been novel when Casino Royale came out and the franchise was shrugging off the spectre (sorry) of the silly '90s, but now all that self-seriousness is dated and tiring."
0," It's hard to believe that a film this weightless would waste so much time on setting up the premise, then never exploit the premise."
1," Exodus is, if still not necessary filmmaking, a plenty enveloping, even stirring, film, as Scott and his cast find interesting variation to play in small details and modest embellishments."
0, Leonetti offers no suspense or surprises and can't get a decent performance out of anyone.
1, A weird meta take on romantic comedy.
1," Woods' delivery of Hades' dry lines is priceless, and makes the movie worthwhile on its own."
1," Sunshine has a more ethereal look than the average science fiction movie but, considering the subject matter, it works."
1," In some ways The Circus is Chaplin's Stardust Memories, his reflexive self-observation in which Woody Allen's line, 'We like your earlier, funny movies,' flashes subliminally among the frames."
0, Lucky You is like the old joke about the classified ad: 'LOST DOG. Three legs. Blind in one eye. Missing half his tail. Recently neutered. Answers to Lucky'.
1," [Peter Bratt] deftly edits together archival footage and interviews with Huerta's children, co-workers, collaborators, and Huerta herself. He backs it with a jazz and salsa soundtrack and tells the story with zest and clarity."
1," A beautifully written, effectively acted, and meticulously crafted effort."
0, Why do film-makers insist that Zac Efron must have regular shirtless epiphanies in the shower?
1, Closer to a Coen Brothers farce than A Civil Action or North Country.
1," No great shakes, but it's well-made and often very funny."
0, Here's betting the new film version of Romeo and Juliet probably won't inspire a new generation's passion for Shakespeare.
0, Alien vs. Predator is a cool-looking lunchbox that's full of rocks.
0," The Last Photograph features some fantastic performances and interesting elements, though this is not enough to make up for its sloppy editing and uneven script."
0," Ultimately, Pilgrimage is an unsatisfying film, one that winds up feeling pointless."
1," Susan Sarandon is terrific; delivering a superb and shaded turn for what could have been a broad ""rude grandma"" phone-in."
0," Like Bush's presidency, it seems lost: it lacks direction. W. could very well stand for why?"
1," A bit of a cliched stomp, but entertaining enough and if it makes more people talk about RBG's achievements and seek out more - then great."
0," Far from the Madding Crowd has the not uncommon effect with a classic of sending one back to the book, for reassurance that Hardy really did achieve what the film hasn't."
1," The ""here comes the bribe"" relationship between these two likable personalities mirrors that of an ice cream cone that starts off freezing cold and then deliciously melts from the sizzling summer heat."
1, Von Trotta doesn't do justice to this strong woman and her contribution to thinking about the nature of evil. 
0,The film is very big on sunsets and sunrises. It also has a touristy appreciation for all manner of things folkloric. What it doesn't have is dramatic coherence or backbone.
0," Though Ponyo contains images so haunting that it's hard to dismiss altogether, this is one of Miyazaki's feeblest efforts."
0," The animation is still strong - there are some interesting and refreshingly uncuddly depictions of the spirit world from whence Kai springs - but, mainly, KFP3 is too much of a good thing."
1, Full of much more heart than you might expect.
1," It might not pack nearly as big a punch as Disney's other offerings, especially fresh off the emotional devastation that was Infinity War, but Solo: A Star Wars Story is still a journey worth taking."
0, Bland coming-of-age story with poorly written characters.
1, One of the things on our 'list' for this year was seeing this movie.
0," The talented cast and colorful vulgarities work overtime to cover for a lack of coherence, but they can only distract for so long."
1," With luck, [more] skills will develop in Polley, and we'll have the opportunity to watch them. For now, though, we have Christie to look at. And the heartbreaking slow-motion tragedy of a vibrant woman being buried alive under the shifting sands."
1," Wise's film is overlong, sometimes over-emphatic, and it has a staggeringly misjudged ending. But it's also notable for centering on the emotional plight of the paranormal malarkey. "
0," A sucker for a cheap sob, it left me cold."
1, Lost City of Z is a lush and sweeping study of colonization and masculine pride.
1, Kingsway certainly does get funny at times but the film's content delves into dark comedy territory.
0," Derailed doesn't crash and burn, but it should be more intriguing - it falls all over itself trying to be really clever."
0," Somewhere between ""Praful the film"" and ""Simran the Bollywood movie,"" a fatally self-aware actress might have overcooked her goose."
1," Hot on the heels of the excellent Alex Gibney doco comes a more personal, less forensic, far more insulting look at the religion...The best bits come when Theroux goes nose-to-nose with Scientology camera crews who have a habit of popping out of nowhere. "
1, More heart and soul than The Grinch and The Cat in the Hat put together.
0," Chick-flick extreme, heavy on the syrup."
0," For an R-rated romance about a young writer's affair with a sultry French siren, ""5 to 7"" generates all the heat of an Easy-Bake Oven. It aims to sizzle but quickly fizzles."
0, Live By Night is a disjointed mess.
1," Cross I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry with the all-but forgotten 1970s farce The Gay Deceivers, then dress it up with elaborate musical sequences: Et voila!"
0, Feels like a half-hour TV show inflated into a feature film.
0," Coming in midway between 'Up in the Air' and 'Failure to Launch,' this comedy about a long-distance romance neither soars nor crashes and burns...not great and not terrible, just mediocre."
0," If there was any doubt that this Olsen twins vehicle would be targeted directly at the dirty old men of the Internet who know just how many days remain before the gals turn 18, it evaporates minutes into the flick."
0," Director Christian Ditter paints a pretty but hollow, hetero-normative and infuriating portrait of singledom."
0, I'll tell you what Brad's status should be: face well and truly slapped.
1," What Petzold does is to move on from literal Nazis and turn Seghers' tale into a melodramatic parable for our present moment, where not only Middle Eastern families have to flee from untold horror, but Caucasian Europeans, as well."
1," Despite its occasionally unfinished feel, Hoodwinked will probably keep everyone (adults and kids) entertained for its very brief running time."
0, ...l feels like a Hollywood vision of the way the ignorant and unwashed comport themselves. It feels ugly and it made me sad.
0, Another movie that toys with ideas but forgets to establish a credible atmosphere.
1," You could maybe see it working as a play, though the tactile detail of these scenes needs close-ups on the actors' faces to communicate what the transaction means to them both."
0," Plays closer to the Joel Schumacher campy sequel Batman & Robin: convoluted, junky and obsessed with form-fitting leather costumes."
0," Strictly for those who are currently watching the PBS series: that is, the preschool/kindergarten audience."
1, Writer/director Joel Hopkins' unforced dialogue and the two lead performances make 'Last Chance Harvey' come across as tasteful and true.
0," When appreciating the heuristic nature of the hackneyed Fear Dot Com, do yourself a favor and be sure to log off immediately in reference to this misguided nightmarish nonsense."
0, Nine does have some good song and dance and not much else.
1, It's honestly hard to imagine any other actor of [Gosling's] generation so realistically embodying the restrained dialed-back countenance of men of this particular generation.
0,A lame blend of comedy and action in which both credibility and laughs are blown to smithereens.
1," It's no bummer or mind-bender, but it might as well be the ""Requiem for a Dream"" of Adam Sandler's rowdy resume. George Bailey never would have farted in Mr. Potter's face, so it's clearly not a wonderful life. But it's decent enough."
1," Bujalski is a shrewd comic observer, and astute enough a director to get the most of his engaging actors."
0, Who'd have thought that the demise of several cities full of unnamed people would act as a perverse sort of marriage counselling for a couple in nuptial distress?
0," Will the Farrellys mine enough gross-out scenes to generate a box-office buzz? The idea that they won't is the air of desperation that hangs over the movie and which, too often, suffocates it."
1," This might be the deepest ensemble of any film of the year, giving each character a standout moment that makes you hold your breath. No one stands out more than Viola Davis. "
0, A scalding look at a writer's life
0, Lowriders has a lot of thoughtful parts that don't quite mesh into a coherent whole.
1, One of the darkest visions of humanity I have ever seen.
1," Dragonslayer is an amazing window into a particular part of the culture and how we live now. You'll think about Skreech -- his father's day gift for his son, his new job at a bowling alley -- for a long time after you leave the theatre."
0,Gary Larson did more with this idea in a single Far Side panel than Steve Oedekerk and his army of animators can muster over eighty minutes in this tepid computer-generated kidflick.
1,Caustic fun.
0," [Randle] holds the film together as best she can with her luminous presence and dignity, but can't supply the lacking subtext, past history and motivation."
0, A pseudo reality horror pic in need of an exorcist.
1," Where many filmmakers would have underlined the bleaker, harsher aspects, Girlhood presents the characters' grim reality without surrendering its lightness of touch, its compassion or its hope."
1," This adaptation of Tim Tharp's novel, directed with delicate restraint by James Ponsoldt, sneaks up on you. It makes you laugh, then it breaks your heart."
0,"Intelligent, superbly acted and finely observed, but Jindabyne suffers from too many extraneous elements and from a story that doesn't land with enough force or purpose."
0," If you think being a CIA assassin is tough, try making sense of a teenage girl!"
1," Mangold's remake of 3:10 to Yuma isn't as startling a resurrection job as his Johnny Cash biopic, but it does send a saddlebag full of western tropes skittering into the 21st century."
0," Everything about the way the movie version of ""Veronica Mars"" came to pass is more intriguing than the movie itself."
1,"The movie isn't perfect, but it's good enough, and better than most. It should keep us occupied until the big screen version of The Apprentice comes along."
0," The irony is that just about any actual Mexican wrestling movie is funnier than this would-be parody, which never gets off the mat."
1," With a simple storyline that can be slow at times, Cara Delevingne's new movie will earn a place in the hearts of teenage filmgoers. But it doesn't offer the same emotional punch as The Fault In Our Stars."
0," The herky-jerky storytelling is unsatisfying, and the characters may not even be vivid enough to qualify for two-dimensional."
0," Dwayne Johnson is completely committed and some jokes really land, but most of it is sadly uninspired."
0, A game of Angry Birds is far more enjoyable than this flocked-up mess. A script written in wingdings would have been preferable.
0," Thoroughly predictable in every way including an obvious ending that tries unsuccessfully to bluff the audience, Deal feels fake and trite."
1," Overlong but ambitious, Woo proves he's as good at tactical maneuvers as he is at close-quarters combat."
1," Like many esteemed classics of the genre, Bone Tomahawk is an exploitation movie at heart, but has the courage of its convictions to treat its material as a gory grindhouse feature, albeit one made with love and effort."
1," Whatever Works is reminiscent of Allen's much-loved films about relationships in Manhattan in which comedy vies with angst, with a soupçon of Jewish humor."
0, What might have been a penetrating film about the war and its after-effects becomes a standard war movie that often feels like a shooter videogame. 
0," Ferocious werewolves suppressing their inner humans, up to no good undocumented undead illegally crossing borders for no reason than as possible filler, and sexy vampires that make panting girl hearts flutter and swoon across America."
0," Beauty and the Beast will come as a colossal disappointment, bringing back into focus an elephant-sized question that nostalgia doesn't want us to answer: what exactly is the point of these live-action reimaginings?"
1," It's vivid, substantial and works hard to be worthy, but as it ticks off the milestones of a monumental life it flickers more often than it really catches fire."
0,"One thing's for sure-if George Romero had directed this movie, it wouldn't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head."
1, This superlative film set the pattern for myriad documentary-type dramas to come.
0, The by-the-numbers narrative ultimately prevents the viewer from working up any real interest in or sympathy for the protagonist's exploits...
0," The movie also introduces the concept of time-traveling fetuses, yet we're never treated to this in any visual way."
1," This feels like the opening act of a feature-length film that would provide greater context, and more closure."
0, If Oz the Great and Powerful only had a brain. And heart. And courage.
0," White Irish Drinkers contains a cast of characters who are as loud, brash and pugnacious as that title would suggest. They also represent just about every Irish-American stereotype."
1," The movie takes a little longer than necessary arriving at the inevitable, somewhat hokey ending, but it's pretty funny along the way."
0," The sarcastic, nasty tone of smug hipness clashes mightily with the film's shrill attempts at sincerity and lesson-learning."
1," ...clearly the best of the prequel trio, and for me almost as good as Return of the Jedi. But this is largely because there are no Ewoks involved."
0," Slapstick humor, a rehashed plot and generic voice casting."
0, Sam is never scary; he's just a threat because he has a gun and nobody else does.
0," From the producers of ""Stranger Things"" and ""Arrival,"" this ain't any of those."
0, The movie never digs beneath the most obvious layers of its L.A. stereotypes. 
1," Everything is fully realized and superbly crafted; the sense of intimacy Leigh creates as writer and director is never broken, for better and for worse."
0," Adapting from Susan Minot's bestseller, Hungarian director Lajos Koltai's (Fateless) pulls together a formidable cast - Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, Toni Collette - but then leaves them to wade through a sickly stew."
1," A dark, insidiously funny satire on the self-involved ways otherwise rational people can allow narrow personal agendas to lead them astray to the point of self-destruction."
0," 'Hercules' is a mediocre movie; it's not bad enough for me to say it's a waste, but it's not good enough to recommend it. [Full review in Spanish]"
1, Pioneer remains a captivating thriller but is a film that seeks improvement in certain areas.
0," Unconditional love is a joyous thing when extended from a parent to a child. Between a film-maker and his subject, it is more problematic."
1," It is amazing what Argento has been able to do in his 65-minute ""The Black Cat,"" which is the more ingenious--and gory--of the two parts. "
1, ... a Pixar picture with all the care and love and storytelling magic that the studio brings to every project. Which makes this adventure a joyous reunion and a lovely odyssey.
0," Everything in Cradle of Life has a kind of robotic precision to it, as if looking perfect were enough to give a movie a soul."
1," A zippy, enormously entertaining heist movie that, with a kind heart at its core, encompasses the styles of yesterday, today, and if we're lucky, maybe even tomorrow."
0," Despite a reliable cast led by Scott, Patricia Clarkson and Peter Sarsgaard, the human impact is ultimately lost in a too calculated scenario."
1," If you see only one black and white film disguised as a road movie this year or next, make it Nebraska."
1," Creepy, clever and caustic, Time Share is a terrific film that crawls under your skin "
1, Backgrounds are crammed with detail and sly visual gags that warrant a second or even third viewing.
0," Del Toro has crafted a predictable movie that will likely only appeal to modern moviegoers thoroughly unfamiliar with Jane Eyre or Henry James or Bluebeard or Daphne du Maurier or, heck, even The Silence of the Lambs."
0," The effort is there, but nothing can save 'Click' from being another raunch-fest starring the emoting challenged Sandler."
1," This pleasantly diverting, none-too-strenuous arthouse excursion feels like a throwback to Allen's short-story anthologies, with the added pleasure of seeing a game cast play along."
0," This film was able to fill 90 minutes with the dissection of one scene, but the road is as full of success as it is with imprudence. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0, I found this adult animated mockery most unpalatable.
0," If Younger truly wanted to work out some fantasies on the big screen, Prime is the dullest, most unimaginative way he could've achieved that goal."
1,The second film to spring forth from J.K. Rowling's popular series of children's books goes a long way towards amping up the dramatic tension promised by the source material.
0," This all has the potential to become a sidesplitting caper. ... Unfortunately, only a few of the manic scenes work."
1, A labor of love hobbled by a stubborn desire to eke its delicate love story out of a premise that all but sits up and begs to be treated as a political thriller.
1," If you're prone to carsickness, this might not be the ideal movie for you. But as a meditation on the way human beings fill the silence - or choose not to - it's an amazing accomplishment. "
0, At least the filmmakers were smart enough not to split this into two movies. 
0,"Too vicious to speak to bleeding-heart liberals, too pro-academia to speak to No Child Left Behind advocates, and too preachy to speak to youths."
1," The film puts its viewers through a wringer and through a journey, right up to its final glimpse of a soldier, though long returned, finally beginning to come home."
1," It's not exactly exciting material, but Panahi's gentle humor and sense of realism keep it from becoming dull."
1, This movie is as much a eulogy for a country that Eastwood sees as slowly crumbling as it is for the life Earl chose to lead.
1,Not so much a slow burner as a damp squib.
0, An ambitious but undisciplined mess of a movie...goes all over the place and winds up nowhere.
0, At once the affair feels deeply personal - writer/director Chris Kelly adapts the story from events in his own life - and yet wildly broad.
0," The seventh Trek extravaganza emerges as a disappointment, slightly better than the inept Star Trek V but markedly inferior to Parts II and VI."
0," Undone by a wildly inconsistent tone, narrative devices that rotate between incongruous cuteness and bald-faced lying, and a protagonist who's just a horrendous, despicable character."
0," Yes, it's time for another visit to the Adam Sandler Death-of-Cinema Fun Factory, the big-screen version of a terrible sitcom where laugh tracks are replaced by the co-stars chuckling at their own awful material."
0," We Were Soldiers is embarrassingly inept, but it has the kind of ponderousness and serious air (not to mention the ability to wring tears) that can fool people."
0," Sleepless is the kind of actioner that does best in cable TV syndication loops, where you can tune-in for excitement while remaining distracted otherwise."
1, Ruffalo gives one of the most appealing performances I've seen from an actor in recent years.
1," As an intimate portrait of the complex, fruitful and extremely volatile friendship between trailblazing African American men whose daring came to redefine an industry, it's fresh and revelatory."
1," Best to approach Mirror Mirror like a waking dream. The story doesn't make much sense, but the visual cues meld into one another with the finesse of a painter blending his colors."
0," The mixture of sitcom and soap opera that worked in 'Terms of Endearment' feels stale here, especially since the final-reel revelation is more cheat than treat."
0," Greenaway's obsessions with sex, food, and vengeance sometimes cover up the fact that he has no idea how to explain why people want anything, but not here."
1," By the time we reach the climax of this smoking modern western, the conclusion seems both tense and inevitable."
0," Frequently repetitive and surprisingly boring, Mr Nice fails to really get to grips with its subject and is ultimately something of a disappointment, despite a superb central performance from Rhys Ifans."
0," Enchanting moments are scattered throughout, but Ismael's Ghosts feels chaotic and uneven."
0, A thoroughly ugly film for an audience that doesn't care who's shooting whom.
0," Choppy, tangentially related scenes follow upon one another, dragged further down by witless dialogue and nasty behavior."
1," The film version is a beautiful, fascinating and moving picture of a courageous life in a strange and humbling paradise."
0," With the success of Hostel and the Saw movies, another wave of cinematic nausea is upon us. Turistas tries to ride that wave all the way to the bank, but it's too timid and perfunctory to get very far."
1," Director Steven Soderbergh's latest turns anti-capitalist fare into commercial entertainment, crafting a studio charmer cut loosely from the mold of his Ocean's movies while recontextualizing residual ideas he previously explored in his independent, two-p"
0," Within the barebones scaffolding of its story, there are ample opportunities for delivering many massive martial arts smack-downs. All are wasted."
1," This is a serious examination of what it means to commit, to trust, and to make yourself vulnerable."
1," It's a one-of-a-kind film about a one-of-a-kind screen legend, a man who transformed acting without ever really knowing what he thought of it."
0," As a piece of storytelling, The Haunting In Connecticut is pretty lazy. As a horror movie, it's lazier still, bringing out every annoying shock-cut and disorienting sound-design trick of the last decade."
0," With a little more plausibility, Hush could have been a thriller worthy of Hitchcock rather than just another potboiler."
1," Grim and compelling but, ultimately, inspiring - and never less than thrilling."
0," The whole thing goes down like a second, giant tumbler of scotchy scotch scotch: familiar, comforting and, ultimately, numbing."
0," Becoming Jane isn't purposefully cynical but if you stop to consider it, it rather undermines Austen's great talent."
1," Smart and passionate, this is one of the ultimate Hollywood fantasies: an adult romance performed by gorgeous actors with palpable onscreen chemistry."
1," Mermaid is a solid dramedy with heart and, more importantly, a message."
1," While it's not quite a return to form, the film is welcome comeback vehicle for Gibson."
1,"There are enough laughs, winning performances, attractive people and appealing romance to make Hitch an amusing option for the Valentine season."
0, The real crime in Elysian Fields is that it completely misses more compelling stories.
0, Like the Punisher says to one of his victims: 'Let me put you out of my misery.'
0, What's the point of being clever if you're just going to follow it up with enough flaming-sword action and exploding bad guys to make our pupils hurt?
1, This insidious tale of a mother-son bond gone haywire is squirm-inducing stuff. It has cult potential stamped all over it.
1, It never really gets under the skin in the way Cronenberg does at his best.
0," Where Woody Allen's Manhattan intellectual and pithy lines always evinced a smile when delivered by the auteur, in the hands of his replacements they are just not funny."
0, This sophomoric comedy views Austen fans as silly romantics who revel in the social artifice of Regency-era memorabilia and obsess about finding a Mr. Darcy
1, Fairly predictable ... but the characters and their progressions are simply too appealing for that predictability to hinder the film's charm.
1," A movie that goes ""bump"" in the night"
0, I'm sorely disappointed.
0," A fair amount of intelligence has gone into San Andreas -- but not into the extremely corny dialogue, which seems designed to make the audience groan."
1,Williams' scene as Dobbs debating his presidential opponents alone is worth the price of admission to this film. It is laugh-out-loud hysterical.
1," It marks a major step forward for Chinese feature animation, as well as the culmination of a journey that took the filmmakers more than a dozen years to complete."
0," The derivative Bratz is a great big pink marshmallow of a movie, aimed at one demographic only: tween girls into fashion and lip gloss. Anyone else, enter at your own risk."
0, Proof positive that so many people are just too eager to lavish praise on a project that involves British accents and period costumes.
0, ...Be Cool is a paper-thin copy that traces the outline of the original without bringing anything new to the drawing board.
0," I wish another director had chronicled the life and times of the vibrantly alert Tony Kushner: Mock's docu is diffuse, rambling, and fails to delve into some crucial issues pertaining to the playwright's creativity and personal life."
1," These characters have to suffer a heavy emotional toll and thanks to some outstanding performances, those same feelings will resonate with audiences. "
0, Insipid characters and sloppy writing make Ragini MMS 2 unintentionally funny. The movie offers nothing more than a few cheap thrills.
1," A little more tweaking for the actual actor's voices to come through, instead of trying to put them into pre-concieved places, may have worked better, but on the whole, it's still an excellent example of how the ensemble comedy should work."
1," Based on his autobiography, this film is clearly designed to be the definitive film about Nelson Mandela. "
0," [Frames] an entire story around a one-note, shtick-based gnat better suited for occasional scene-stealing than prolonged audience sympathy."
1, There's a goofy boldness to the way they take the current awkward trend of rebooting a popular series and make it the literal goal of the mutants themselves.
1," The star of the pic may well be NYC's Guggenheim Museum and Istanbul's Grand Bazaar, both of which figure in cool action chase sequences that pay handsome dividends."
1," When Alita pirouettes into action, Rodriguez doesn't fail to deliver."
0," It's a ""what if"" story that's hopeful but doesn't ring true."
0, Director Sam Mendes fails to make them as beautifully fragile as he wants to.
1," Not quite the fairest in the land, but certainly fair enough to keep you enchanted by the sets, costumes and a delightful Chris Hemsworth."
0,"Silent Hill"" isn't worth clamoring about."
1," Even amidst the trauma the movie discusses from a quiet distance, Lija makes it clear that none of his humanitarian work is due to the war. "
1," Authenticity may have been breached, but the film's revelations still feel earned, and achingly truthful."
1," Rousing ""Rogue One"" a worthy entry in the ""Star Wars"" saga."
0, The whole distasteful mess is sunk up to its neck in a brew of Southern Gothic atmosphere and hocus-pocus sentimentality.
1," Refreshingly well-balanced, Illuminating, provocative, vital and engaging. You'll never look at Zionism the same way again."
0, Its banality knows no boundary and every actor contributes to it. 
1, A dark humored film that challenges viewers at all times. [Full review in Spanish]
1," Ingrid doesn't preach, and it's deliciously cruel without ever denying its characters their essential humanity. It has sharp teeth and a big heart - more comedies should be like this."
1,"Following L.A. Confidential and Wonder Boys, this makes a remarkable hat-trick for Hanson and is a personal triumph for Eminem."
0," A bomb in no uncertain terms, an ill-formed, stupidly plotted, morally unclean thriller."
0," You've seen it before, and you'll see it again. In one way or another 'Did You Hear About the Morgans?' is the same old fish-out-of-water story that's been put to film dozens of times."
0," It's [an] admirable move, but not a successful one."
0,"Cool to look at, but there's nothing to it."
1," With a huge, well-chosen cast and the blessing of Miller, who was on set as Rodriguez's co-director, Sin City is a gloriously stylized world unlike anything you've seen before on screen."
1," A maddening movie that gives the viewer plenty to think about, but little to care about."
1," How fitting that just a month after Stan Lee died, the most detailed homage conceivable to his art and legacy lands in cinemas."
1," Good Manners is a seductive werewolf fairytale that left me feeling stunned, exhilarated, and craving more."
1, The actresses find their own rhythm and protect each other from the script's bad ideas and awkwardness.
1," Taking aim at every level of Italian culture, Martino and Gastaldi put together a surprisingly enjoyable caper. Sure the hard-hitting exploitation of a title and subject like that are dismissed early, but as a film its watchable and nicely put together."
1," A top-drawer cast, sympathetic script, a director known for delicious teen edge and one of the great cinematographers of our time have conjured up a topical, whimsical and occasionally magical action-romp through a world we know, but don't fully see."
1, A sci-fi thriller that presents a riveting and rounded anatomy of fear.
0,"Never work with children or animals. Unless you're a child or an animal, in which case, never work with Cuba Gooding Jnr."
0," A solid premiere effort that shows Reel FX's potential to produce quality full-length animation. But the story-line, with its hypothetical constituents, seems a little desperate at times, even for a kiddie film."
0,Meanders through an unconvincing plot that has neither the suspense of a spy film nor the emotion of a family film.
1, There can be no more beautifully shot or perfectly framed film out in London at the moment than Claudia Liosa's allegorical tale.
1," If for no other reason, the film should at least be seen for its visuals -- or, rather, for White's visuals."
1,"A quite powerful drama, based on a true story, that relies on familiar storytelling tropes."
1," World War Z is less intense than any given episode of The Walking Dead, but there are undeniably suspenseful moments nonetheless. It's atmospheric and brainy."
1,Director Schwentke swoops around his giant set with an energetic style that keeps this widescreen film from becoming too claustrophobic.
0," Saw V attempts to make the audience feel smart for sticking along for so long, only when it's all said and done you'll feel like a fool for sitting through this disappointment."
0," The Clapper is just so boring and corny that all the audience can do is either feel bad for Helms or disingenuously applaud his unsuccessful efforts, mimicking his character's chosen vocation."
1," The piece as a whole feels earnest and well-meaning but rarely compelling, a film that is almost too decorous to be as involving as it should be."
1," ...Burgundy barely qualifies as a character. Better to think of him as a living one-liner, albeit a very funny one."
1," A diverting showcase for Baruchel and Eve, who are excellent arguments for the proposition that there's more to a person than looks."
1, One of Mark Ruffalo's most engaging performances.
0, A fascinating true story... is buried in a mundane story of generational conflict.
1," Crowd-pleasing drama explores race, class, friendship."
0, Deal is fatally earnest: It honestly believes it's the first poker film to have a mentor character tell his young protégé that success in cards is similar to success in life.
1, It sometimes attains greatness -- mostly within the confines of its genre -- but it can't maintain its greatness.
0," Derivatively written, [and] has a laughable villain, but its success still needs to be celebrated."
1," Despite running out of gas and getting slightly bogged down with its obligatory message, Lilo & Stitch provides a happy summer distraction."
1," The guys could make 12 more of these movies, do just as well every time and get audiences to laugh and laugh at themselves for laughing. That's a lot of laughing, and that's The Hangover: Part II."
0, Stealth is a pretty fair military-hardware action movie until you start thinking about it -- at which point it turns incredibly sour in your mouth.
0,[Yimou] turns the Rape of Nanking into a visually stunning melodrama. But the effect of such extreme contrast is unsettling to say the least.
0," In the poorly paced and ineptly edited Haunting in Connecticut, Matt is surrounded by dark shadows, ooky male choruses, and reflections of tortured corpses in dirty glass."
1," A brilliant work of art that's bold, daring and unpredictable."
0," The performers are given stock types to play, and Elba and Dillon, at least, can do a little with that."
1," While the film could benefit from a bit of trimming early on, its success at showing real lives unfathomably impacted by barbarism is beyond dispute..."
1," The talking heads are a gathered chorus singing Ferencz's praises. What's clear in Prosecuting Evil is that Ferencz is far more convincing when speaking for himself, and for those who didn't survive."
0," While the movie frequently gets things right, the big intricate revenge set-up in the second half is mishandled and muddled."
1, This is a thrilling noir that takes no prisoners and pulls no punches.
1," Ancient history may be Greek to me, but 300 packages it like a Happy Meal -- bloated with empty calories and too much cheese but still very tasty. Boy toys included."
1, It's interestin that the main character is so unlikable yet so interesting. [Full review in Spanish]
1," If you're a Darin and/or a Spacey fan, this film is a must see. It's just that where I'm supposed to enthusiastically applaud, I find myself sitting on my hands."
0, too little too late
1, Affleck proves he can convey suffering as well as any actor alive. His trebly voice is cracked with pain. He comes with his own chill fog.
1, Imagine Pulp Fiction printed on real pulp paper and you get an idea of this movie's full-immersion approach to bringing a comic book to life.
1," As a feature-length translation of a television show, Cowboy Bebop is pretty good."
1, ...missing the angry comic energy of Judge's previous efforts.
0, A major disappointment.
0," It serves as both a talent-squandering prequel and sequel to Snow White and the Huntsman, while doing nothing more than name-check Snow White."
0," If robots had to make a movie without human help, Surrogates is what they might come up with. All the parts are visible, but there's no soul to be found."
1," Its portrait of the grotesque über-privileged has considerable bite, bracingly reveling in the greed, selfishness, bitterness, jealousy, neurosis, detachment, and hunger for power and sex ..."
0," Saoirse Ronan is terrific. So is Cate Blanchett. But chase, chase, chase = No tension, no surprises. No fun."
1," If any of his movies was ever to reflect [Neeson's] current career trajectory of fine performances in average fare, it's this one."
1," Hidden Figures isn't a ground-, ceiling-, door-, or wall-breaking movie, but it entertains through its cast's charm."
1," The story flows through its chapters, allowing us to get to know Johan, his hopes and insecurities, and the other members of the choir group. "
1, A documentary about a confident young woman who despite her disabilities makes a daring transition into independent living.
0," With its somber palette and plot-with-potential, Aatma could have been a true scare-fest. But it winds down to being well begun, half done."
1, Amiable and hollow.
0, A well-intentioned sketch of a movie...
1," Denis Côté's ""walking dead"" movie presents a metaphor so literal even squirrels could keep up but it is nevertheless affecting and watchable."
0," There are more than enough giant logic holes, stilted characters and idiotic developments to make sure that it is bad for reasons transcending its simple poorness as a sequel"
1," It's brutal, bloody and brilliantly entertaining."
1," Another visually scrumptious cinematic doily from America's master of over-designed whimsy, Wes Anderson, and this one is measurably better than many of his previous efforts in that there's something resembling a plot at the heart of it."
1," Hwang's directorial debut is audacious in its style, ambitious in its themes but slightly uneven in its tone."
1, The unreconstructed nature of the comedy ensures that the jokes and even the shots are awfully familiar. 
1, demonstrates Spielberg's mastery of the fine art of infusing the bleakest of material with a sense of optimism that swells in your heart without blotting out the tragedies and losses that came before
1," ""Wonder Wheel"" doesn't quite reach those heights, but it is always exceptionally watchable."
0," A gorgeous ""Blade Runner"" look-alike that feels, start to finish, like an opportunity missed. "
1, Nothing short of wonderful with its ten-year-old female protagonist and its steadfast refusal to set up a dualistic battle between good and evil.
1,"We expect beautiful music from The Soloist, but we suffer through some blaring false notes along the way."
1," While making a political, historical biopic, Van Sant managed, concurrently, to make a visually beautiful, emotionally thrilling and surprisingly personal work of art."
0," Instead of what was promised, we must struggle through...a bad 90's romantic comedy masquerading as a comic book movie."
1," Tucci successfully banishes...cliches in a finely observed character study that possesses the ring of careworn, unprettified truth."
0," ...the car chases are dull, the stunt work isn't very interesting, and the characters would have to be fleshed out to become cardboard figures."
1," ... the framework in which the athletes seem mere pieces of a game of chess between the great powers, rather than individuals who want to overcome, continues to be worrisome in this great documentary. [Full review in Spanish]"
1," If Only God Forgives evoked Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, then this is Refn's Mulholland Drive, and the best film to play in theaters so far this year."
1," I think Bier might be a little too acute an observer of human behavior to agree with the simple premise of her film's title, but she makes us believe it for a while, anyway."
1," May not always be crystal clear, but has plenty to recommend it"
1," I may be wrong, but my feeling is that I won't be able to say I have properly seen this film until I can see it on the big screen."
0," Despite stylish editing, lively performances and some effervescent dialogue, Skills Like This eventually becomes insipid, tedious, inane and a bit lackluster."
1," Unlike self-consciously unconventional biopics, The Imitation Game melds fact and invention with lucidity and sweep."
0, Justice League is going to have a tough row to hoe to win over audiences following Batman v Superman and now Suicide Squad.
0," The film plays coy with its quintessential indie-dramedy setup, eschewing narrative and tension in favor of convivial character interplay and master shots of wintry landscapes."
1," There is so much on the line, so many dire circumstances that the characters' peril grips your attention. Keeping viewers on the edge of their seats, from beginning to end, is the mark of a well-crafted and executed film."
1," Red Sparrow runs long, but captivates with a strong lead performance and shocking violence. It is easily the most graphic film we've seen from Jennifer Lawrence."
0," X-Men, Avengers, and everything Transformers: These were the ingredients chosen to create this unnecessary sequel but director Dave Green accidentally added an extra something to the concoction-Chemical Cliché."
1, The brilliantly eerie Let the Right One In is the European Angst Zone's answer to Hollywood's Twilight.
0, This isn't funny. It's sad and disheartening and demeaning...
1, There's no denying that Zeitlin is an emerging artist of serious talent.
1," ""The Face of Love"" is a serious look at grief and finding romance after losing the person most important to you."
1," Trzebuchowska is certainly the film's other great asset: all the performances are great, but she is not even an actress, having been spotted by a producer in a cafe and hired almost on the spot. You'd never believe it."
0," The most and least that can be said for ""Hangman"" is that it doesn't approach the mesmerizing ineptitude of ""88 Minutes,"" another movie that pitted Al Pacino against a serial killer from about a decade ago."
1," From its opening frames, Hereditary digs its claws into you and doesn't let go."
0," For all this gymnast-lingo about ""sticking the landing,"" the movie still falls flat on its rear. "
0," I tried, but I couldn't make it all the way through this film."
1," A quick-witted, profane and cynical quasi-comedy in which history is merely a costume."
1, Its characters' vacant aspirations are equated by Stranger Than Paradise's lack of conventional purpose - this is the film's idiosyncratic strength.
1,"Newcomer Kyle Stanger, who was just five when the movie was made, gives Lumpy so much personality and charm that every child will want a heffalump playmate of of his own."
0, The 3D cameras capturing the concert at New York's Madison Square Garden can't give their insipid guitar pop or their charisma-free presence the extra dimension they need.
0," It's all about the writing, and it's definitely uneven in ""The Five-Year Engagement""."
1, A movie for anyone who's ever been a teenager.
0, Those of us who had the good fortune to watch the TV series The Jewel in the Crown or Ivory's Indian films will learn to miss them with this film: something is something. [Full review in Spanish]
1," What will Wright and Pegg set their targets for next? I don't know, but I'll be watching."
1,"The supporting cast are excellent, particularly rising British star Rebecca Hall as Borden's wife and David Bowie,looking disturbingly like Ricky Gervais in a bizarre turn as mysterious scientist Nikolai Tesla."
0," Gibson dwells on the gory details of laceration -- one whipping after another and another and another -- until it's the viewer who's tortured, hurt, defensive, and, finally, numb (if not driven to retaliate)."
0," There really isn't much of a campaign to document - Barr, who says she doesn't like shaking hands and meeting people, mostly Skypes from her Hawaii home - and it's hard to tell exactly what to make of it all."
1," A moving meditation on history, knowledge and mortality."
1, Ellison manages to find beauty in the quotidian - such as the pink glow of storefront neon illuminating a casual chat.
1," Best seen in IMAX 3-D, the movie takes full advantage of the format, showcasing the wondrous rock-and-ice covered landscape and extreme elements."
0," To call ""World's Greatest Dad"" a cynical and mean-spirited black comedy would be giving far too much credit to a sad piece of exploitation cinema that barely manages to spit out its theme that most people are idiot leeches attempting to leverage a meaning"
1, Not Suitable For Children is a refreshingly solid and raw Australian 'dramedy' that delivers poignant characters and relieving laughs while highlighting our fragile and absurdly fleeting existence.
1," The adults who are so desperate to return the kid fugitives to their care actually envy the children's freedom, irresponsibility and, yes, love -- in a word, their youth: The kingdom that makes exiles of us all."
0," Its early allegory may be blunt, but its second half begs for something even as heavy-handed as that to keep it involving."
1, [The film's] grittiness instantly adds to the historically and socio-economically convincing picture of working-class Yorkshire in the last century.
0," Too often, though, Growing is an exercise in well-trodden territory. In spite of showing off her own skin, and in spite of how personal this special is, Schumer's revelations rarely get past the superficial."
0, There is a story here but it needs a better writer and director to flesh out the scenes and characters.
1," It is a tale of white trash immorality on a grand scale, of people who are ridiculous and yet dangerous, laughable but cunning, and really stupid ... yet sneaky."
1," Last Holiday isn't much more than a fantasy, but it's a sweet one, and it's far more worthy of attention than such hideous garbage as Rumor Has It . . . ."
1, It might get corny but for Robertson's unaffectedly gritty settings and understanding that modest gains can be enough for checkmate.
1," There's a mesmeric intensity to Jackie that's unlike any biopic of its kind, marked by a deliberate effort to narrow the scope to one woman's actions and reactions over the course of a few fraught days."
1, One of the scariest movies ever made.
1," Stewart and cinematographer Bobby Bukowski cover it all in a straightforward, watchable way, the performances are all sincere and solid and the situation is easy to respond to emotionally."
0," Ironic, then, that 20th Century Fox's quiescent sales job may ultimately cost the film a suitable first-weekend box office splash."
0," Too bland to qualify as a really notable disaster, ""Young Ones"" finds young Paltrow still trying to find his voice."
0," With one or two bright spots, this is a mostly uninteresting, occasionally uncomfortable affair that is simply not as subversive, enlightening, or as taboo-breaking as it sets out to be."
0," Neither scary nor exciting nor much of anything, save eyestrain."
1, Costner effortlessly blends deadpan comic flair with action movie heroics in this preposterous but entertaining genre mashup.
1," The low-key cross between Sideways and Before Sunrise proves to be a fine fit for Reeves and Ryder, who display their combustible love-hate chemistry from the meet-cute -- and get lots of laughs out of their com."
0,This is one of those utterly generic films that could easily have been spat out by some over-the-counter screenwriting software.
0," ""Blindspotting"" is filled with passionate intentions, but debuting director Carlos López Estrada doesn't know much about restraint. "
1," Thoughtful and slick, it functions both as a riveting thriller and also something that's deeply conflicting, compelling you to juggle all angles of the scenario during the film and long after, too."
1," It remains the most subtly romantic and highly atmospheric rendition of Bram Stoker's tale about the Transylvanian count, with Browning orchestrating the opening scenes to macabre perfection."
1, A small suspense-thriller to scratch your Hitchcockian itch.
0," Unwilling to settle on one climax to his lumbering narrative, Polanski seems to have included them all."
0, ...like a Florida dinner theater production of The Lord of the Rings...
1," An emotionally resonant, nerve-jangling experience."
0, I sensed I was missing part of the experience. A big part.
0," The writing is unfortunate, attempting clever repartee between the attractive stars, but just succeeding in making everyone slightly embarrassed."
0," Lizzie doesn't do much to distinguish itself, either as a morbid slice of feminist mythmaking or as a brooding work of psychological portraiture."
0, The movie might have been better served by a director not hellbent on rubbing pretty much every head wound in the viewer's face.
1,"Director and co-writer Michael Showalter's script, especially in scenes about Doris's hoarding and the way her family relates to it, is slack, and the ending's a bit too pat. Still, it's fun to watch great actors do their thing."
0, She only sort of does it.
0," Bangs and clangs and has some impressive effects, but it seems to have forgotten one thing: These movies used to be giddy, rock 'em, sock 'em fun. This one is just plain grim. "
0," Lightly amusing in a Cheech and Chong way, though its central fantasy concept sputters to near-irrelevancy."
1, Arterton's performance is incredibly emotive and well-judged.
0,"There's the seed of a good satire in American Dreamz, but the film flops spectacularly due to a poorly written screenplay."
1,This engaging and tightly constructed drama explores the role of the senses in the lives of a group of Canadians. 
1, Combines poignancy with realism for a touching yet not overly sentimental exploration of an Inuit man and boy's deep need for family and tradition in a Quebec TB ward.
1, This is as close as any of us is likely to get to witnessing life in prehistoric times.
1,"Still as high-octane the second time around, even if it's firing on a few different cylinders."
1, An impressive and sometimes mesmerizing directorial debut.
1," It glosses over what exactly made Alan Turing so brilliant, resulting in a monochromatic picture that could have been - should have been - told in bright, striking color."
0," Intends to be a character study, a serious exploration of who this biblical icon might have been, but it also packs on the CGI-heavy combat and tired characterizations."
0, It proves very much un film de Sandler: so lazy you feel unconscionably guilty for snorting at the three jokes in its two hours that merit any response.
0," It's a tame version of Saw, aimed at middle-aged America, with the same lack of brains and appeal."
1," Anne Hathaway shatters her ""Princess Diaries"" past for good with Rachel Getting Married"
1," Konstantin Bojanov's film exudes an elemental, intriguing mysteriousness, a reminder that things remain unseen and in a state of unrest."
1, Captures the dreamy intimacy of those teenage relationships where boundaries between friendship and love prove porous.
0, Mediocre acting and writing keep Monster Trucks in the so-so zone.
0," On a technical level, at least, The Good Dinosaur is the most dazzling Pixar movie yet. As a story, however, it's the studio's weakest by far."
0," ""Anchorman 2"" is like watching ""Anchorman"" being re-enacted by semi-professionals trying to cover up their lapses by being extra-emphatic, super-doofy: 2013 Steve Carell does a lousy impression of 2004 Steve Carell."
0," The story isn't bad, but the script (for which three people get credit, John Brancato & Michael Ferris and John Rogers, always a bad sign) is occasionally bromidic."
1," Flashing backwards and forwards through time, the film includes enough emotional firepower and startling revelations to keep you guessing at every turn."
0," Radcliffe is amazing, and the film is worth the price of admission just for his performance. It's just unfortunate that the film around him is guilty of a bit of sloth."
0," Bar. Big breasts. Bodyguard. Jason Statham! Cockney, mate. Vegas, innit?"
1," It's direly beautiful, sometimes spine-tingling and, yes, gloomy as purgatory."
0, A good-looking but flat period piece whose neutered telling renders its nutty narrative increasingly hard to believe and harder to care about.
1, A story too densely plotted to feel real but too well built to fall over. 
1," If it is possible to be at once clear-eyed and sentimental, Kawase achieves that in this heartbreakingly beautiful film."
1," The splendidly mixed and visually overstimulating movie might make your head explode on the spot, Scanners style."
1," Dunkirk, tellingly, is the first of Nolan's films to induce tears in its final frames. The director's technical mastery finally transcends craft to become art and, as a result, this is his best film to date."
1," A literate, leisurely and lovely telling of one woman's attempt to find what Virginia Woolf famously called ""a room of one's own."""
1, Cries out for an easy one-word review of 'Wow!'
0," Factor in the unintentionally funny dialogue, the hey-look-over-there attempts at making you jump, and you'll see that the real trap here is the price of the ticket."
0, The greatest weakness of Green Book is that it insists on trying to find the humour in nearly every situation Shirly and Vallelonga encounter.
1," A worthwhile stab at approaching the zombie subgenre in a character-driven, personal manner, Maggie lacks the substance to soar and occasionally plods along like a lethargic zombie."
1, Wonder Woman is not just the first great female-led superhero movie ... but an astounding example of modern blockbuster filmmaking in general.
1," Has almost no redeeming features beyond providing empty entertainment for a couple of hours, which it mostly excels at doing."
1, It's a rousing film about ex-colonials uniting to assert their pride and to recover a dignity that continued to be denied them by the English and Australians.
0, A remarkably incompetent science-fiction thriller.
1," For a first time filmmaker, Blakeson shows a formidable sense of control, restraint and stylish flair reminiscent of a more established helmer and despite the odd misstep, takes the time to ratchet up the tension and intrigue."
0," Reitman clearly wants to get at something human in his films - connection, family, humanity - but he lacks the artistic tools to explore those things; a man stabbing at the stony soil of an archaeological dig with only a Q-tip to uncover its wonders."
0," ... the story itself could have done with a bit more development, especially in its conclusion, while the acting is flat."
0," Clunky and at times, confusing, Here and Now fails to give Sarah Jessica Parker the chance to dive deep into herself and give the emotional performance she was hoping for."
1, This buddy comedy is no classic on the level of Pineapple Express...
1," Will it win any awards for 2013? Well, no. But 'Gangster Squad,' a shoot-'em-up nod to pulp thrillers, will provide solid entertainment for fans of crime dramas."
1,"A rather silly affair, but what gives it some distinction is that it actually has some bite."
0," It has that same kind of hit-and-miss comedy about it, and Allen is really just going through the motions at this point, just as Groucho often was."
0, Content to be another candy-coloured fantasy. It'd be easier to enjoy it as such if most of the young characters here weren't mean-spirited caricatures who chiefly serve to illustrate Sam's virtues.
1," It's a smart and timely reminder that every superhero's story has to start somewhere, and Miles Morales' fascinating story begins here."
1," Run All Night may not have the makings of a particularly memorable thriller, but with a highly-entertaining storyline that's almost constantly at full-throttle, it makes for a rather enjoyable on-the-run/revenge flick."
0," Whether we're watching the domestic struggles of Kidman or Law doing moody wandering, scenes run on randomly, and don't build into a structure with arc or emphasis."
0, Jeremiah Chechick's The Right Kind of Wrong has more wrong than right and plays like an ode to testicle jokes.
1," Certainly one of the better Salman Khan movies in the recent times - watch Tiger Zinda Hai for its action sequences, excellent background score and performances by the ensemble cast."
0, There are a lot of great ideas struggling to find their way out of this misshapen hulk of a film.
0, Requires such large amounts of suspended disbelief that one wonders if the film is principally aimed at children.
0," Not good, then, but not especially terrible and infinitely preferable to the excrescence of Hart's previous outing, Get Hard."
0," Pitt seems wholly miscast, and Cotillard turns in an awkwardly pitched performance."
0, A muddled mystery.
0," Much darker than the previous films, this third installment feels more like a horror flick set in amusement park than a good sci-fi adventure, though special effects, due to technology advances, are more sophisticated."
1, Loving is basically an exercise in subtelty. [Full review in Spanish]
0," Sitting through Super Troopers 2, I was nostalgic for the days when you could blame studio executives for backing lazy, unnecessary sequels."
0, Filmmaker Franc Reyes would have been better off skipping the elaborate scam plot and focusing on the conflicts that arise when a dealer trades in his gold chain for an Armani suit.
0," An uneven, ultimately unsatisfying attempt to transfer the groundbreaking and boomer-beloved 60s TV exploits of Rocket J. Squirrel and Bullwinkle Moose to the big screen."
0," Unfortunately, the film is disappointing on a number of levels. This is partly the failure of Noyce and his screenwriters to bring out the strengths of Greene's novel; it is also a function of some rather unfortunate aspects of the great writer's work..."
0," Pixar mined the superhero genre far better six years ago with The Incredibles, and DreamWorks itself is capable of superior fare like this past summer's How To Train Your Dragon."
1," Finney's a superb storyteller, dominating the film as he lies immobile, and McGregor has precisely the right blend of cockiness, enthusiasm, zeal and charm."
1," [Mottola] doesn't always find the right tone in trying to cover such varied terrain, but you have to admire him for trying inject some substance into what can be a predictably mindless genre."
1," Although Carrey threatens to chew the scenery whenever he can, the kids hold their own as the stars of the show."
1," It's a mistake to label it a gay cowboy or queer romance, for this love story is universal in appeal, epic in scope like Giant and unabashedly romantic like Wuthering Heights."
1," Full of passionate performances, sizzling swordplay, bold and dazzling hues, and breathtaking landscapes."
0,The episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life. But the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored.
1," Only now and again does one get a wash of something unifying, deep - a suggestion of adult depression and disillusion."
1," All in all, ""Their Finest"" is an amiable and pleasant movie; a bit funny, a bit sad."
1," Does it work? Yes, if you like Rogen, but if you don't you'll feel that Gondry has fiddled too much with the original by giving his star full rein."
1," Either the perfect vehicle for Jenny Slate, or evidence that Jenny Slate can turn anything into a profound, hilarious performance. I'm willing to believe the latter."
1," ... most of the story and characters -- and all of the creepy, unsettling mood -- remain intact ..."
0," George is desperate, a point hammered home when, as he's recording a sportscasting demo, his concentration is broken by a phone call from a debt collector."
1," The snazzy, stylish black and white photography is not only appropriately expressionistic for the dips and valleys of Hopper's career; it gives the film a sense of visual personality that's often sorely lacking in bio-docs."
0," ""Maps to the Stars"" is an ugly little movie, unrelenting in its despair and depravity, which is exactly how director David Cronenberg wants it."
1, That the movie is as tense and chilling as it is owes much to first-time director Jon Stewart's keen eye for the way humor surfaces even in the dark places. 
1, There are moments when the movie is wittily revolutionary.
0, Thirty years later Reynolds still looks fit to play the lead; Sandler still looks like a water boy.
1," When it sticks to thrills and spectacle and, you know, horror, there is unmistakably exciting potential in seeing the first glimpses of Universal's Dark Universe take shape."
0, The film is an unequivocal product of this time of sensitivity and over correction. [Full Review in Spanish]
0," Taken 2 must not be taken 2 seriously, although at the very least Megaton could have found better ways to use all those glorious, antique-looking Istanbul backdrops."
0, a fragile premise stuffed with hollow Christmas jokes
0, The biggest load of hooey to stink up the screen this year.
1, U.N.C.L.E. has fun playing with Cold War tropes in the decadent playground of 1960s Europe.
0," Incompetent pewter-plated ""Silverado."" Nice locations, though. "
0," Here, for a movie that attempts to portray such an interesting life, the result is pretty bland."
0," Forever After isn't as jumbled and irritating as 2007's Shrek the Third, but it's still decidedly pointless."
1," Its drama is often turgid, but its musical sequences are spectacular. And you couldn't ask for a better soundtrack."
1, A touching and acerbic Japanese drama.
1, McCarthy has honed her particular brand of comedy to a fine edge and proven she has a considerable arsenal to draw from; but she's also reached the point where she's drawing from what she feels comfortable doing as opposed to reaching for new levels.
0, A kind of nifty little sci-fi noir that's only satisfying if you don't pay attention to the fact that it doesn't really do anything besides look cool.
0," Aksar 2 is a movie that begins well, but quickly crumbles to a point of no return. "
0," The film takes the revelations and twists at a hectic gallop, though it omits the spiritual, Gaia-is-angry mysticism of the original. It's not too bad, though it lacks the style of the recent film version of State of Play."
1," A late entry in a crowded field, Spiderwick works hard to set itself apart from the competition, and almost entirely succeeds - no mean feat these days."
1," It's deceptively simple, but it does so much so well. It's heartbreaking by the end...It's just really, really powerful. "
0," Summer Coda is disappointing, an under-nourished, spasmodically involving melodrama set largely amid the orange groves of Mildura in rural Victoria. "
1, This is an ensemble film. It's as much about what goes on behind closed doors in straight marriages as commitment-phobia across sexual orientations. 
1," A warm, sentimental glow prevails at the end, while copious shots of rolling landscape offset the teatime-telly feel of veteran goggleboxer Rod Hardy's direction."
1," In the latter stages, the film becomes increasingly sentimental, and even risks turning into a full blown tearjerker, but it never feels trite or manipulative."
0,[A] laugh-free comedy.
0," Representa uma imensa oportunidade perdida de explorar os talentos de Carell e Fey, que certamente poderiam formar uma dupla bastante eficaz caso estivessem trabalhando com um material melhor."
0, Bored me silly. Really silly.
1," Absorbing documentary on the career of actor, storyteller, and performance artist, Spalding Gray."
0," Baron Cohen and Strong are both robustly physical performers, and their finest moments are when they're grappling with each other, producing a great tangle of limbs and teeth. But the script... is not especially generous to the other members of the cast. "
1, A very funny Hollywood story with a gay character who doesn't mince or terrify the straight characters and comes out without being punished. If only this weren't a satire.
0," Though the sequel is a welcome return of the four women we know and love, it's tough not to acknowledge that if we were all friends in real life, at this point we'd probably stop taking their calls."
1," Throughout, Devos manages to capture the passion that made Leduc so difficult to deal with at times, but which also compelled her to put her unvarnished thoughts and experiences down on the page."
0, It's his heavy-handed and often ludicrous plotting that is the film's downfall.
0, What's missing? A sense of the ineffable. 
0," Stilted, shallow and dull with too much sugar-coating and oversimplifications. "
0," Serving as Kick-Ass' mentor, savior, and inspiration, Hit Girl is a perfect and perverse fantasy -- abused and abusive, tearfully vulnerable and ingeniously cruel."
0," ""The Aspern Papers,"" brief as it is, needed more of a lightness of touch; if you weigh down melodrama too much, it dies."
1," Should be a monster hit with tween girls but should have wide appeal as did Freaky Friday, another similar picture."
1," This is a movie that just works, and it's a joy."
1," The directors score a coup in getting testimony from the police officer who led the raid, a now-elderly gentleman who freely confesses the fear that rippled through his unit, and his regrets in having been on the wrong side of history."
1," The jokes do not always land, but Guest's affection for this gang of misfits elevates this above the simple exercise of shooting fish in a barrel."
1, A movie that is as happily warped and enthusiastically disturbed as the rest of [director Guy] Maddin's eccentric cinema.
0," The context is passionate, but the film is more hermetic than mysterious. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0," Epstein and Friedman opt for the most broadly entertaining and salacious details about the 1972 porn film, giving short shrift to Lovelace's complicated contradictions."
0," There's a spark here, and a flicker there, but mostly Righteous Kill is all fizzle."
0," It's ironic that in 2003 we find Murphy playing a role that, for all intents and purposes, might have been done by Mantan Moreland 60 years ago -- only Mantan was funnier."
0," Tame and timid from beginning to end, and relentlessly conventional."
0," Hawke gives his all here -- or maybe just half his all -- and it isn't quite enough: He's trying to be soulful, but he really just looks a little tired. The real delight is Willem Dafoe."
1, The pulse-pounding action scenes are briskly directed by Doug Liman.
1, Relentlessly gripping.
0," ""Dragonfly Eyes"" disappoints with its unsatisfying combination of an ultra-banal narrative told in a formally original way."
1," Fun and illuminating...The movie as well as the song serve as fitting, entertaining testaments to the resilience of the Jewish people."
1," To its credit, the film isn't sensationalistic nor is it political agitprop. While the violence is concrete and upsetting, it's virtually tame by contemporary Hollywood standards."
0," A road movie with a lofty message that too frequently gets lost in its own thematic barrens. Whereas Krakauer's disturbing book sticks with you, Penn's movie, wrapped in the balloon of its fanciful rhetoric, just floats off."
1, Fans of [Cage's] work will relish his extravagantly oddball performance as a dark avenger in this luridly overwrought horror movie.
0," It was difficult by its origin that this film was a masterpiece, at least it could've been more funny and surpass the original series (which isn't much to ask for). [Full review in Spanish]"
0,"William Blake may have once stated ""The road to excess leads to the palace of wisdom"" but I'm guessing that if he ever had the opportunity to see the ""Crank"" films, he might have had second thoughts about that."
1, Kasdan's gift for the smart crack is consistently undercut by a well-developed taste for schmalz.
1," Nail-bitingly intense, thanks to some powerful performances and Tobias Lindholm's strong direction and fantastic script."
0, Maybe they should take a lesson from the movie itself: Stressed out moms deserve better.
0, The science-fiction thriller Skyline falls squarely -- and a little endearingly -- into the Roger Corman tradition of cheap cash-ins on popular hits.
1," It's to Ozon's credit that he never serves up easy answers, and even after ample scenes of sex and showdowns with those closest to Isabelle, and even a scene with a psychologist, we're none the wiser as to what's driving her."
0, An uninformed audience is left with a movie that feels like 90210 meets Mr. Wizard. I'd rather watch David Copperfield make the Statue of Liberty disappear for 153 minutes than endure this flick's trite magic tricks.
0," Joyce Hyser, affecting a lower register, a short haircut, and a subtle swagger, is not totally convincing as a boy because she's too pretty and too chic."
0," Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey give lively performances, but the screenplay is dreary."
1, Expect to leave exhilarated and more than a bit disturbed.
0, Director Bharat Nalluri compounds the chintziness with a full-throttle approach that blows away any lingering nuance from the source material.
1," The transgression of borders by an endless storm of exiles not only exposes violence and the state of emergency in various parts of the globe, but the perpetual quest to preserve life. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,"Even when the film connects, I can't help feel that it's mostly because it's set the target too low."
1," ""Basterds"" is very audacious with comic book-like characters and dialogue, a B-movie sensibility and a serial-like disdain for logic."
1, Shows what the world saw in Vreeland: a fairy godmother determined to dress up a world of Cinderellas.
0, To put it bluntly: this is a bad movie.
1," Once the media caravan departs, the doc meanders, torn between its obligation to reportage and its interest in a town riven by America's thirst for justice. "
0, The rare modern kids movie that offers absolutely nothing to anyone over the age of five.
1," This will naturally prove a summery fave for the small-fry, even if the songs don't quite hit the heights and the final act feels a little flat."
0," ...Opting for a broad, light mood that's at complete odds with the darker potential of its political premise."
1," Um filme sensível, tocante e admirável."
0, Here [Fisher] is giving it everything she's got and it's just not enough.
0," If this story had been handled by any one of the filmmakers behind one of the other science fiction indie darlings of recent years, Replicas could have been made into something special."
0," Witherspoon has charmed her way through weak material before, but she's too inexperienced to save the character from director Andy Tennant, whose main achievement here is to turn his star's natural twinkling menace into malice."
1,A great American film. A dark and sometimes bleakly comic vision of our violent culture.
1," Succeeds on the shoulders of Simmons, who's fantastically moving when Henry familiarizes himself with his son's favorite music as the lone remaining way to connect with him. "
0," Alas, first-time director Scott Winant and screenwriter Winnie Holzman rarely get beyond the cuteness of the story's structure."
1," Underneath the silly carnage, there's a tremendously fun film, but as a starting point, it signals the start of a potentially big new franchise."
0," Dench deserves better, and unfortunately it will probably be a long time before she gets another starring role in a movie custom-made for an actress her age."
1," Both exhilarating and disturbing, a fast-paced epic about business, family, and self-worth."
0, This sequel is pumped with a lower-octane gas than the earlier films.
0," Man, did they blow it with this one."
0,"For a film that wants to decry business as usual, Man of the Year seems awfully content to play by the rules."
0, The Ice Age flicks are the cinematic equivalent of drive-through nuggets of reconstituted chicken slurry served by a bored teenager in a cardboard hat.
0," A particularly cynical brand of celluloid nihilism, in which über-wealthy movie producers finance their Hollywood mansions by marketing films to an audience feeling disenfranchised by the status quo."
0, Too transparent and unintentionally silly to accept all of its faux-sincere message-making.
1," More workmanlike than spectacular. But armed with an A-grade cast giving it their all, it transcends its shortcomings to give a breezily entertaining crime story."
1,"Follows a rather predictable, well-worn path, but the sheer joy of performing on the actors' parts sells the film as a whole."
0," The movie version feels forced, even though it doesn't seem to know what it means."
1, ... come for the beauty and adventure of seeing nature's last holy land but stay for the interesting and unusual story of individuals who brave isolation and privation to experience something that so few have ever felt.
1,"As in his gorgeous film Far From Heaven and TV series Mildred Pierce, filmmaker Todd Haynes tells a simple story with visual impact and thematic resonance."
0," The movie boasts a strong lead in Orla Brady, but I have to say it didn't quite work for me."
1,It reminds of what Cholodenko is capable--and of the promise that she might get there again.
0," With mediocre performances and style, but a whole other screenplay's worth of content to grapple with unfolded in its... final act, Gleeson's film is a sea of ideas with only a lifejacket keeping it afloat."
1," There is only one problem with the excitement generated by this film. After it is over, you will walk out of the theater and, as I did, curse the tedium of your own life. I kept looking for someone who I could throw up against a wall."
1, A sad and scary film about the ignominy of dying alone in a hospital room surrounded by strangers and without dignity.
1," Like big steaming chunks of charred animal flesh, or a fleeting glimpse of a gal's ample cleavage, Death Race taps into something very primal (and very male) about the action movie experience."
0, You have to hand it to the Coen brothers. Even their cinematic 'failures' are pretty interesting.
1," . . . not only one of the finest documentaries ever made on dance, it's one of the most superlative documentaries of the nineties."
0, ...as satisfying as a weeks-long case being dismissed on a technicality. It makes all that time feel like a monumental waste.
0," Except for a few bright moments with its cast, Stuck on You doesn't stick with you in any way other than to remind you the Farrelly brothers have lost their touch."
0," The whole project feels workmanlike, an exercise in neither offending nor impressing."
1," Pleasingly thorough and inventive in its treatment of a well worn subject, and quietly smart about dealing with the way things can change over a few hundred years."
1," The real scene-stealer in this violent, well-paced movie is Vera Farmiga as ""Mom,"" the matriarch of the racist-skinhead family, who wields soft-power maternal love and affection for her ""lost boys"" almost diabolically."
0," Although more flashily assembled, pic's relentless onslaught charms less over a running time almost 25 minutes longer."
1,"The Farrelly brothers brand of humor is present, but the jokes are incorporated into a surprisingly effective coming-of-age story."
1," Under the guise of current events, Skolimowski artfully conjures an elemental archetype of human life itself. In English, Polish, and Arabic."
1,Romanian-born ex-painter Negulesco aims for sophistication with Hitchcockian banter between rivals -- Lorre and perennially suspicious Sydney Greenstreet -- and a crafty Wellesian figure of hearsay in Dimitrios.
0," The ""illegal alien"" gag is a lazy joke, contingent on ridiculing otherness in the most insipid ways. Bitches, Mexicans, they all be crazy."
1," A vibrant, mature love letter to the making of movies, the meaning of movies, and the dark-eyed muse Penélope Cruz..."
1," Angry white males with suicidal tendencies are people, too!"
1, A fascinating and heartfelt documentary about members of a storied U.S. Army battalion and their experiences during 2010-11 deployment in Afghanistan.
0,Obsessed with how clever it thinks it is that it completely sinks the romantic comedy pirate ship it sets forth to be
0," With ""The Matrix"" the Wachowski Brothers created a sci fi action classic, with its two sequels they destroyed a franchise and now with Speed Racer they have destroyed another one right out the box."
0," A touch of ambiguity never hurts, but too few dots connect in this story, and we're left with a portrait that only can be admired from a distance."
1, Not just an efficient babysitter but a wizard of a movie.
0, Rob Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses is a movie by a man without any sense of modulation.
0, Proof that Cage will sign up to anything that involves a mad hair weave and a motorbike.
0, The film is so slow and distant it's more likely to test one's patience than their faith.
0, The movie would have benefited from a more raucous and freewheeling application of its premise.
1," Like Penn, Pfeiffer takes what is essentially an obvious, insulting character and turns it inside-out."
0," Cocote tells a relatively simple story in willfully obscure, opaque fashion. While the pic features many intriguing elements and often proves visually stunning, it ultimately feels a trial to endure."
0, Not much here for grownups to enjoy ... apart from watching the kids get a kick out of the film. (And the pigeons.)
1,Much of the credit must go to Jessica Walter for her outstanding performance which somehow manages to be chilling while at the same time sympathetic.
0," Watching a movie by the comedy troupe Broken Lizard is watching a neighbor's party from an outside window. The people inside seem to be enjoying themselves, but they haven't bothered to invite you."
1," Prepare to be pleasantly surprised by A Perfect Getaway, a compact, no frills thriller that does it's job nicely."
0, You could put Will Smith in this and call it Wild Wild West Europe or Nicolas Cage and call it International Treasure.
1," While Green Room goes slightly daft towards the end, the brutality and adrenaline you experience along the way more than make up for it."
1," Live-In Maid, Jorge Gaggero's remarkably assured first film, examines the complicated relationship between an upper-class Buenos Aires woman and her housekeeper."
0," A dog-eared, virile action film that's lucky to have Rebecca Ferguson as a saving grace."
0," Sure, the action sequences are thrilling. But the emotional intensity and gravitas of Skyfall are missing, and that makes the movie feel more like a string of highlights than a satisfying whole."
0, Too predictable and far from deep.
0," The filmmaker is off his game, veering uneasily between half-hearted comedy and shrug-worthy drama, and ends up exposing some of his familiar flaws."
1," As bleak as a Dickens novel, yet twinned with a contemporary heist drama, Metro Manila straddles two worlds in telling the story of a desperate family man who moves from a small farm to the city."
1," A visual masterpiece, the cinematography by Flavio Martinez Labiano is excellent. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, The filmmakers' subtext - at least in the movie's first quarter - seems to acknowledge that you can't top the original. And they didn't.
1," Beyond its awesome cuteness factor, ""Pandas"" dramatizes the benefits of cross-cultural cooperation, showing a path forward for similar endangered species."
0, This Great Indian Biopic Syndrome strikes again with Manjhi - serial offender Ketan Mehta's third consecutive interpretation of real events...
0, Drink the Kool-Aid. Wear blinders. Cover your ears. Because that's the only way you can totally enjoy Revenge of the Sith.
0, At least Hasselhoff's dumb show didn't actively make you feel worse about the state of the world.
1," Recent events - the Columbine massacre and the news, just this week, that a young Florida girl killed herself after being taunted by bullies who allegedly boasted about it online - have added resonance to the source material."
0,"This is what passes for middle of the road comedy these days, safe without being prudish, never too disturbing, never too funny."
0, Goldman and director Richard Donner don't know when to stop mining a gag and to move on. That the film runs in excess of two hours is indicative of the filmmakers' love affair with scenes that don't work.
1, A school-teacher's dream as Patrick Stewart tells his nemesis that the principal goal of every human being should be to become a better person.
0," Given the luminaries ... dotting the cast, this ought to be some kind of fun, but it's not nearly as much fun as it might have been"
1," Ponyo has elements of both a classic fairy tale and an environmental message movie, but it shifts as nimbly between those genres as Ponyo herself does from person to goldfish and back again."
1," For sheer balletic violence -- and a rousing, climactic High Noon-like face-off finale -- The Equalizer delivers on what Washington and Fuqua promise."
1, Time Out of Mind challenges audiences to accept Richard Gere as a homeless man who has been living off the grid for nearly a decade.
1," Nowhere near as good as its reputation. A cheesy mess, supported only by its nostalgia."
1," Refusing insincerity, demanding attention, and committed to the art of performance, Stritch's life seems tailor-made for a documentary."
1," A noble attempt to give us a look at one of the regular people who populate our civilization, one of the guys we may see everyday but would be otherwise totally unfamiliar with."
1," ""Every piece has its own complications,"" Caleb tells the family at one point in the film, after a prank goes awry. ""The Family Fang"" eloquently shows that every family does too."
0," Writer-director James DeMonaco's The Purge fritters away its promise in lurid, frenzied violence."
0," There are actually 111 guns in 2 Guns, but that sum doesn't include concealed weapons, so we'll never really know the truth. "
0," There's a Dumbledore, there's a Voldemort, there's a magical MacGuffin that our heroes must track down, but it's a soulless attempt to re-create the Potter magic."
1," It gives a far deeper and more engaging portrait of Mexico -- rich and poor, rural and urban, old and new -- than you're likely to find anywhere else this week."
1," The movie will make fans happy, very happy, and it will reduce everyone else to a mass of cooing, goo-goo-ing ninnies, all in the thrall of a character named Baby Groot."
1," Though dark and harrowing, explicit and unsparing, the movie proves a riveting biography of these burnt-out icons and their iconoclastic half-decade."
1," While this episodic film, configured like a short-story collection (think J.D. Salinger's Glass family), is laser-pointer specific, its tensions are universally relatable. And its performances are first-rate."
1," Whatever the book would have been, as a film, it is an attempt to make sense of the modern world by looking back at the past through the eyes of somebody whose words are as relevant today as they were then."
0, Moments of excitement don't make up for what is ultimately a slow burn study of characters that aren't nearly as interesting as the movie thinks they are.
0," Love, Rosie's early charm fades by the end, given that, as time (and the movie) wears on, neither Rosie nor Alex get any more mature when it comes to matters of the heart."
1, Banished offers a startling tour into an unforgotten history that remains invisible to most Americans.
1," We'd call it Crouching Tiger, Freakin' Masterpiece."
0, ambitious if not fatally amateurish
0, The characters or situations just never quite feel real enough to truly make us care.
1, Contains what is perhaps Buster Keaton's most fully realized act of comedic anarchy.
1," The Breaker Upperers is packed full of that awkward, dry-as-a-desert Kiwi wit - the unmistakable rhythm of a bloody good time at the movies. "
1, 'The Polar Express' is a rare Christmas gift for all ages.
1, A potent and unexpected mixture of authenticity and flash.
0," Extravagantly [expends] elaborate sets, special-effects, music, costumes and actor look-alikes for the sake of a few lame gags and a legion of crotch-kicks."
0," Will there be a ""Hatchet IV''? I shudder to think about it."
1,"Gridlock'd is refreshing because it's different. The subject matter isn't new, but the approach and tone are."
1, A coming of age dramedy that loses its way in the mean streets of modern Africa.
0," There's so little chemistry between the two, they might as well have cast Mick Fleetwood and Samantha Fox and had done with it."
0," Somewhere in the midst of the computer-generated carnage of X-Men: Apocalypse, as the valiant mutant students of Prof. Charles Xavier again did battle with the evil mutants arrayed against them, I was struck by a wave of déjà vu."
1," ""Force Majeure"" is a prickly moral comedy for grown-ups, full of sharply observed moments, spectacular scenery and masterfully manipulated atmosphere."
0," This privileged-class filmmaker is so enamored of his romantically outlaw subjects and the woman in-between, his film is just one step removed from ""The Real World: Haiti."""
0," The Farrellys, who with There's Something About Mary helped lay the groundwork for the mixture of raunchiness and heart that Judd Apatow has perfected, seem painfully dated here."
0,"Skip this film, and re-watch ""All the President's Men"" instead."
1, A charming and witty biographical tale of two women who were brought together as soul mates through the art of food and the joy of cooking...
1, The result is at once limited and brutally effective in communicating the emotional stasis of memory and the dehumanisation that comes from the ruthless enforcement of pure ideology.
0," A mediocre knockoff of ""Coming to America,"" if Prince Akeem had been both less funny, and a notorious war criminal"
1," Consistently funny, The Hangover proves you don't need a big-name Hollywood cast to get big laughs. Destined to appeal to the lads everywhere, that the film doesn't only resort to gross-out gags means female audiences should give it a go."
1, He may need a lawyer to tell the nine old men on the Supreme Court he loves his wife. We see it in every frame.
1,Features several strong performances.
0," Undoubtedly the worst big-screen film since M. Night Shyamalan's The Last Airbender...To put it bluntly, Pacific Rim deserves the derision usually lumped upon Transformers 2."
1, Reminded me of the work of Paul Thomas Anderson and Quentin Tarantino.
1, What we do have is ... a stunning performance from Meryl Streep to set alongside her Isak Dinesen and Julia Child.
1, A piece of stagecraft so thrilling -- and spontaneously combustible -- that audiences at the two screenings of the movie I attended kept erupting into applause.
0," Moore and Page don't have great chemistry, which means the heart of a movie about the power of love doesn't quite beat."
0, ... one gets the sense that director Nick Cassevetes and writer Jan Sardi would spray the audience with teargas if they could.
0,"Scatty, intriguing but slightly undercooked ..."
1, Claude Chabrol peaked with this engrossing and shocking thriller.
1," Shows that even in a supposedly 'tidy town,' people still experience things and make decisions that can only be justified by saying, 'Well, you had to be there.'"
1, Rope is Hitchock's underrated classic that contains some of the most unique filmmaking of it's time. Hitchcock was so far ahead of filmmakers back then and so far ahead of a lot of the filmmakers today.
0, It's the absolute pits.
1,"I defy anyone to find a story of first love -- its triumphs and heartbreaks, its feverish beginnings and its sad endings -- that's as passionate or as moving as the one told in Call Me by Your Name."
1," A sequel that betters the boffo 2003 animated feature Finding Nemo and provides more evidence, after last year's highly original Inside Out, that Pixar has finally emerged from the uninspiring years of the Cars franchise."
1," [Okoro] creates a drama with a vivid and personalized sense of locale (the streets are alive), and he shows us how the characters emerge from it..."
0," Often amusing silent black-and-white take on the classic ""Snow White"" tale impresses not much beyond being another visually impactful homage to period silents."
1, While many documentarians feel the need to match images of past events with people and events that are happening right now... They don't need to. We already know.
0," he Look of Love forgets all the other senses when it comes to getting what makes Paul Raymond so fascinating, desensitizing us to caring even less about him than the 60th breast that flashes across the screen."
0," To me, director David Yates in his second outing with the franchise has let style (and maybe some of the technical problems of directing in a hybrid of 35mm and IMAX 3D) swamp storytelling."
0, The Danish Girl is two-thirds of a lavish but harmless period piece. The final thirty minutes or so descends into becoming a preachy and overly melodramatic statement.
1," While it's a film too steeped in actual tragedy to describe as 'entertainment', it's engrossing, thought-provoking, and well worth your time."
1," As a Swedish film, there is a calm in settings and décor you would expect, and Close and Pryce take care not to destroy the scenery in their compelling exertions."
1, Director Eastwood takes [an] utterly predictable script about retired test pilots in space and turns it into gold.
0," Before long we're in 'Death Wish' territory, with the plot turns growing more and more implausible as the picture lumbers toward what might pass for a happy ending [but] distinguished by a ferociously committed performance by Viola Davis."
1," For its courage to address a ticklish subject with warmhearted humor, Breakfast With Scot, adapted from a novel by Michael Downing, deserves a light round of applause."
0, the film makes the worst choice in cinematic adaptation. You know what they can't do on stage? Shaky cam! Why stare at theatrical actors on a level stage when you could see even less with a camera jerking around?
0, Committed performances don't compensate for the lack of substance lying beneath.
1, It's a rousing good time at the movies.
0," Mostly ponderous, despite the unceasingly beautiful imagery."
1," In crisp, painterly black-and-white, we see crops being gathered, snow falling on churches and homes, people gathered for school or Mass. What's not seen, not even to the characters, is their own undoing."
1, A true work of art in the Aronofsky tradition...
0," Willfully or not, the director misses one opportunity after another to pull back and assess."
1," A surprising film of great visual display, where Redmayne manages to carry the two hours of the plot on his shoulders. [Full review in Spanish]"
1," If you want that adrenaline rush of watching Akira beating baddies and punching holes into the system, go for it."
1," If you're looking for a crime story that sizzles with action, sex and the visceral jolt of life on the edge, Miami Vice is the one."
1, This episode brings warmth back to a franchise more frozen than a dead Tauntaun. Let's hope the second and third movies continue the thaw.
0,"I wish I could say that Fast Five was the fastest, most furious movie of the series, and that there wouldn't be a faster, more furious movie all year. I have to be honest though. Fast Five just wasn't fast enough for me, and it's hardly furious at all."
1, A film that is fresh in both style and story.
1," Would that Morel had infused the project with the same variety of style he brought to District B13, but the subtle insights of the script and Neeson's splendiferous range more than pick up the slack."
0," Some strangers aren't worth getting to know, and this is one of them."
1," Basterds is not as the closing dialogue suggests, a masterpiece, but even an off-day Tarantino can still impose shock and awe."
1," Alcoholism and the movies go together like gin and tonic, with recurring lost weekends of wine and roses enabling actors to shine. Smashed is no different, with Mary Elizabeth Winstead's portrayal of a grudgingly recovering drunk leading the way."
1," Akerman highlights the forthright display of a distinctive Jewish-American diaspora culture, which she contrasts with the private and wary sense of Jewish identity on view in her European work."
0," ""The Woman"" is an affront to human decency that no self-respecting critic (even this tolerant horror fan) would enthusiastically endorse."
1," William Freidkin's film is full-frontal in every sense, an unabashed pulp romp stuffed with ugly acts and primal screams."
1, Wiseman does what he does best: creates a holistic sense of a place as an organic habitat rather than a mere organization.
0," In trying through incessant narration to make a six-year-old a prolix sage, Zeitlin can't avoid falling into sticky sentimentality."
0," As the plot spools out and never finds any moments of true narrative clarity, the film's particularities feel less and less sure-footed."
1,"The wonder of the first movie is long gone, but a few thrills still remain."
0," At nearly two and a half hours long, The Yellow Sea is overkill in every sense."
0," Another half-formed feature from indie cinema's most prolific doodler, ""Happy Christmas"" demonstrates that Joe Swanberg makes better babies than movies."
0," In certain mutilated pictures, you can detect the lineaments of greatness: Consider Orson Welles's ""The Magnificent Ambersons."" Here, that's not the case."
1,"There will be movies with bigger casts, louder explosions and more zombies -- but few will boast the sheer spirit of The Kings of Summer."
0, This is supposed to be the start of a new universe...I don't know what you're supposed to do after this. 
1," Documentary filmmaker Amy Berg (West of Memphis, Prophet's Prey) has made an elegant, affectionate and, in many ways, remarkably cheerful film about Janis Joplin."
0,"Big, dull and empty."
1," Meticulous and deliberately paced, Force Majeure unexpectedly hits the viewer like an emotional avalanche."
0," Inane comedies can be fun when done well, but bad inane comedies are simply embarrassing. You feel pity for the actors making fools of themselves, and flabbergasted that a studio probably passed on making so many other more worthy projects instead."
0," This is a dishonest, quease-inducing 'comedy' that had me feeling uneasy and then unclean."
0," I'm sorry to report that beyond that educational element and the delicate performances of Dancy and Byrne, I found Adam dramatically limp, predictable and in a curious way even retrograde."
0,"As an antidote to the sugar, what we need now is a grumpy film called Letters to Lady Macbeth, in which malcontents leave rage-filled missives in the battlements of Glamis Castle."
0,"Xtro is an ugly, mean-spirited and despairing thriller that left me thoroughly depressed. Why was this movie made? What vision filled the filmmakers with a desire to share this work with an audience?"
0," While Jim Carrey delivers a grimly serious performance, the film itself is exploitative, inept and often incoherent."
1," No-one does humour in violence like Tarantino.... Hell's bells, there is a lot to take in and soak up in this hotdog Tarantino Western. It's a killer"
0," If one engages in such an endeavor to begin with, then filing away the harshest edges becomes counterproductive."
0," Given its shiny surfaces, nouveau-chic grittiness and button-pushing sentimentality, this version feels as if it were made by the kind of beings the first three Body Snatchers movies warned us against."
1, This fast-paced thriller's twist-crescendo-ing plot and sharp performances should at least delay the feeling of being duped until after the credits roll.
1,"The result is that valued rarity, an intimate epic."
1," Before Wanted reaches the end of its wild course, the violence that's been nothing but oppressive becomes genuinely if perversely impressive."
0, The truth remains that Lagerfeld's expertly cultured air of mystique is one of his unique selling points and he's unlikely to give up any family secrets to anyone with the clunking interview technique of Marconi.
0," Chandor's debut feature audaciously asks us to empathize with obscenely overpaid risk analysts and their bosses, a gambit that fails... largely because his characters are little more than mouthpieces for blunt speechifying and Mamet-like outbursts"
1," The American Side is a swell trip on one of those cheesy carnival rides, and you'll know it's time to get off the roller coaster when the credits roll."
1," The film's plot is as capricious and changeable as the sea, which may annoy those looking for more to, you know, happen."
0," Rush Hour 3 is everything a sequel shouldn't be: wasteful, unwanted, crass, inept and just plain awful to watch."
1," Soderbergh's creation doesn't fill in any blanks about Gray, and the film is not for the uninitiated, but even ardent fans will have trouble warming up to every detail."
1," An intellectually stimulating and provocative film that raises more questions than it answers. In our age of increasingly rapid technological advances, this examination of the notion of progress is timely. It is, indeed, a vital necessity."
1, A documentary about the everyday spirituality of chores and devotions at an ashram in southern India.
0," Like waves beating on a shore, the guff just keeps on coming."
1," Steven Spielberg's terrific, fun-filled, state-of-the-art photorealistic 3-D motion-capture animation, laying groundwork for a sequel to be directed by Peter Jackson."
1," A feel good movie about feeling good, this fresh and very funny sex comedy stars Parker Posey as a woman in search of an orgasm."
0, The story submerges and drowns in preposterous gothic nonsense.
1," All in all, this is a movie that confronts its own hard challenges - and feels utterly, uncomfortably relevant in this new Age of Anxiety."
1," All in all, it's a pretty diverting afternoon at the cinema."
1, Remarkable and uncannily timely documentary.
1," The simple, even sometimes simplistic script is helped a lot by its cast."
0," [CANNES 2016] Someone could write a Freudian thesis about how, by diminishing a female child character even further than her undeveloped stature, in ""The BFG"" feeds into the imperialist patriarchy that the story ultimately hands itself over to."
0, Hyperactive and visually busy without being much fun.
0, Too distant and remote from his characters to make them live for us or to make us care for them.
0," It's the kind of movie where it means nothing that our heroine hits rock bottom, because she fixes everything in the very next scene."
0," Ultimately, Okja operates on too fantastical a level to function as a call to arms against the factory farm system, and its hot-and-cold tone may scald younger viewers while leaving older ones feeling cold. Consume at your own risk."
0, It's a middle-of-the-road film.
0, The independent film 500 Days of Summer is as refreshing as hot air. It's as formulaic and calculating as the Hallmark greeting cards to which it feigns superiority.
0," Save your money and, more important, your precious time."
1,"The romantic comedy genre needs infusion of new blood, but this film is utterly predictable, by-the-number, thoigh Will Smith has charm. "
0," Neither theatrical fish nor cinematic foul...literalized on film, the theatrical reduction of the [Four Seasons]'s story has an anemic complexion."
1, There remains a frutrating gulf between the fascinating nature of this story and the skillfulness of Jarecki's filmmaking but the potency of the home video footage of the family's splintering makes it worth a look.
0," If you ever wanted to know what kind of movie plays deaf children falling into a sinkhole for laughs, look no further."
0," You can't blame a film based on a book for adhering to the book's idiotic storyline. You can, however, blame it for sucking as a movie."
0," For a time, Surveillance is sick, smart fun. But then things get weird: yes, there's a big surprise, but its playout is predictable, and nasty."
1," Shame on Honeycutt, Gleiberman, McCarthy, and Corliss for giving away the big twist, but even their idiotic and unprofessional decisions can't stop you from loving the movie. Put on your red cape and tight red underpants and get in line RIGHT NOW!!!"
0," Recalling one of those exploitation flicks so popular in 70s drive-ins, everyone involved deserves a pat on the back for producing such a fearless British movie. If only it was better."
1," A potent reflection on progressive politics in America. A meditative chronicle of struggles againstâ""for lack of a more comprehensive termâ""the powers that have been and continue to be."
1," I have always counted on Terrence Malick to make movies that exercise my synapses, and he delivers that here."
0," Not a single fresh idea, nor the faintest glimmer of hope that something smart is around the corner. "
0, Many of the movie's more nominally horrific elements are too familiar ...
1, Anyone who makes horror films should be inspired by movies like It Follows.
0," Any Chekhov is better than no Chekhov, but it would be a shame if this was your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years."
0," Well mounted and cast, The Liberator has all the right surface attributes yet never quite transcends its solid, slightly impersonal professionalism."
0," A movie that, in its static presentation and gangly, geek characters, bears such a resemblance to Jared Hess' [Napoleon Dynamite] that -- gosh! -- you'd think that Hess might need to have his attorneys go after a royalty check or two."
1, Every composition is more ornate than at first expected
1,It's best seen as a breezy entertainment and a reminder of how potent some of these performers -- many of whom are dead -- were in their primes.
0, This PG-13 rated film is perfectly appropriate for any 13-year-old who has served time in an adult prison.
1, Tanks for the memories. 
1," Dull story, some vulgar humor in Lance Bass romance."
1," This authentic and enlightening documentary is visually breathtaking, presenting awe-inspiring and juxtaposed shots of the Earth's many different cultures."
1, Nearly every moment of A Star Is Born feels real and specific. Often painfully so.
0, ... fritters away a cast headed by Michael Fassbender and Rebecca Ferguson.
0, Martin Scorsese's elephantine exercise in B-movie badness.
1, Sandler's and Walken's performances make this worth your while.
1," I found myself resisting the film's pull of easy emotion. There are fundamental questions here, and the film doesn't engage them."
0," Mostly, it's just expertly bloodless-a series of beautifully composed tableaux stripped of all passion. "
1," Featuring tremendous action sequences, smart dialogue and emotional depth, this installment is one of the best action movies of the year."
1," With Walker and cinematographer Dudu Miranda, Muniz has a hawk's eye for the weird beauty of bulldozed hillocks of trash and the catador faces that he chose to star in photographic portraits."
1," For uncomplicated excitement, the film offers a solid one-hundred thirty minutes."
0, a silly spinoff that is far less concerned with telling a worthwhile story than it is with telling the world that Garner has a magnificent bod.
0," Mostly Year One moves along ploddingly, stepping frequently into bathroom humor and never quite funny enough to justify its high concept; when it's over, it quickly slips away."
0," Daniels once again mistakes permissiveness for artistry, creating a picture that looks like it was shot on a reel of dirty underwear, developed in a mixture of spit, semen, and alcohol. "
1, Cause for celebration.
0," The movie, at least, is spot on in one regard: it respects the long-running tradition of January cinema releases by being both lousy and miscalculated."
0, Unfortunately when you take out the humor there isn't that much going for it.
1," A film about fading out, about how youthful passions dissolve over time."
0,Wild Wild West has six screenwriters and between them they couldn't come up with one good idea or one decent line of dialogue.
0," Squanders a way-too-good cast in a meandering, not very compelling cop-and-political corruption story that plays like a half-hearted homage to Sidney Lumet"
1," A moving, sincere British indie that finishes just as it's getting started."
1, A heartening romance for our time as well as theirs.
1," Brody...has a comedian's gangly limbs and a tragedian's melancholy face. For the tragicomedies of Wes Anderson, that's a perfect combination."
1," The action is a little too intense for very young children. But for everyone else, including cynical grown-up critics who didn't think they'd ever give a Fee, a Fi, a Fo or a Fum about this movie, it's a terrific adventure."
1, It's rare to find a film that satisfies our craving for pop while giving us the transcendence of poetry.
1," All Is Lost boils down the art of filmmaking to the essential parts, making even the slightest decisions evident and powerful."
0, Historical adventure is a fun romp for tweens and up.
1, The most searing film I've seen this year.
1," As arthouse coming-of-age films go, this is brilliant -- smart and sensitive with a screw-you feminist streak."
1," The loving, thumb-printed claymation and an anarchic spirit mark this out as top-flight Aardman, over and above the comparative disappointments of Chicken Run and Flushed Away."
1, A realistic and disturbing look at how complicated things can become when lives are touched by violence.
1,This is a movie about a self-obsessed woman who seems to learn that the wisdom of the ancients is that she should be even more self-obsessed. 
1," Their Finest is a definite crowd pleaser that is sure to entertain audiences with its insanely likeable cast, its old-fashioned filmmaking (whether its own or the commentary) and its high amount of charm."
1, Tom Hardy is brilliant in this entertaining gangster chronicle.
0," Mac and Me directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, and it's exactly as good as that sounds."
1,"Third wheel's a charm when the person happens to be Owen Wilson, indulging us yet again with his lovable-slacker persona."
1, Effectively plays lush visual storytelling against its characters' desolate interiors.
0, Bad Seed-style horror movie is gory and ludicrous.
0, It meanders along with poor developed characters and culminates with a weak finale that tries too hard to please.
0, Just doesn't seem particularly inspired.
0," When told that space would be tight this week I asked if I could review Devil's Due by simply saying, 'Trust me, folks, this thing sucks a moose.'"
0," The snail's-pace horizontal pans, under-the-flight-path score, and other arthouse affectations had collided with the overall unlikeability of the major characters violently enough to make me consider jumping ship. "
1, a beautifully designed picture-book tale of a visionary young woman struggling to find her own Order in the confusing world around her
0, The only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater.
0,We have a sad attempt at action which fails miserably.
0," I didn't laugh. I didn't even smile. I just never cared. And cinematographically, the film is much uglier than any television series watched at home for free on your HDTV."
1, [Harry Dean Stanton] gets a last starring role in a bittersweet sunset of a movie crafted as a tribute to everything that made him irreplaceable. It's well-earned and beautifully played.
1," An emotionally naked performance by Theron, an actress who knows how to reveal herself without making a big deal of it. It's a showcase role, but not a showy one."
1, The film focuses on a few activists trying to advance gay rights against the head winds of a brand of Christian religion that openly advocates killing homosexuals.
0, The Look of Love is the latest and -- I'm sorry to report -- the least of Coogan and Winterbottom's team-ups.
1, A colorful and loving tribute to the kinds of restaurants that food critics once ignored - and a few fancy places as well.
0,It frequently seems as though Jackson was less interested in making The Hobbit than in remaking his own fabulously successful Lord of the Rings series.
0, Doesn't grow tiresome; it already is once the clever opening titles are through.
0," Bolt is perfectly amiable but rarely brisk, with neither its premise nor its execution quite inspired enough to elicit more than faint admiration."
0," Neveldine and Taylor simply spray their venom across the screen with little vision, once again making a friendly trip to the multiplex feel like undeserved torture."
0," It's one of these vending-machine movies: a good-enough, easily forgettable flick that benefits from selection bias and low expectations."
1," One of the best films of the year, and, when it's all said and done, probably the decade."
1," At the end of the day it is a pretty formulaic bromantic comedy, and the little bit of a twist it has can't hide that fact. But it's done really, really well and that counts for a lot."
0, This is not The Cat in the Hat. This is kitty litter.
1," American Honey's brazen modern take on sex, adolescence, and the American dream gone wrong is a challenge, but one that's ever so rewarding."
1," Fierce, deftly entertaining work of muckraking journalism."
1," If it feels like the prequel to a smoother, pacier heist film, at least this is sufficiently charming that we might see a follow-up one day."
0," Somewhere along the development trail, someone in charge should have said: Arm! Get me a rewrite, arm!"
1, Intoxicante ejercicio visual que se aleja completamente de la cinta tradicional de superhéroes para adentrarse en el dilema moral de todo héroe que se sabe finalmente humano.
0," Rich in quirky performances, amusing in its restless energy, it nevertheless frustrates with self-import and fishy enlightenment."
0, This whole movie is pretty much a mental colon blow.
1," The verdict is in, and Dredd is an ultraviolent good time."
0, The sad thing is good romantic comedies are on the endangered species list. The Bounty Hunter proves the point.
0,Nothing exceeds like excess in The Expendables.
1," This is a perfect beer and pretzels movie (or pasta and meatballs, if you prefer)."
0," Very, very sleepy and low-key."
1," If you're game for it, ""Mother!"" is another of Aronofsky's ominous extravaganzas."
0," Leder returns to the big screen with an effort that feels intended for the small screen. While it tells a great story...""On the Basis of Sex"" feels like a Lifetime movie."
0," There's not much of a payoff, as this tepid film telegraphs its mild punches from several miles away."
1, [Kilcher's] transformation from an innocent in Eden to a stranger in a strange land and back again is a remarkable bit of largely nonverbal acting.
1, This film is an independent gem that would make for a perfect girls-night-in flick. 
0," It's certainly a goodhearted story, and the movie does offer a little plot twist that deviates from the usual formula. After that, though, The Game Plan quickly reverts to the established playbook for safe, sappy family fare."
1," Five years after The Girl on the Train, André Téchiné tackles another real-life cause célèbre in which the central transgression may never have occurred."
1," 'Poética y sobrecogedora, es una obra de arte que nadie que ame el cine puede dejar de ver'"
0,An interminable oral sex and flatulence joke masquerading as a movie.
1," Disney has a good hair day as the revamped story of Rapunzel leaps from the screen, and not just because it's made in 3-D."
0," It's obviously formula stuff, and follows that formula so earnestly that at points you'll wince more than swoon (why does every big proclamation of love in the final scenes need to be made in public?)."
0, There's no reason the movie had to be this terrible.
0, The Other Side of Hope fulfills the vague sense of its aspirational title as a film limited in scope and led only by the guidance of its maker's skeptical positivity.
1,"Cooper gives a characteristically virile performance, his dominance of the outlaws quietly believable, while London achieves some touching and convincing moments in a difficult role."
0, This overwrought dud shouldn't have left DreamWorks' CGI studio.
0," A well-acted, but poorly-constructed missed opportunity."
0," There are some good ideas in there, even timely. But eventually, like everything else in the movie, they're washed away in a sea of blood and a hail of bullets."
1," ""unfocused and erratic, but with an undeniable charm"""
1," Even though it's all build-up and little in the way of scary pay-off, the film still works to a certain extent, just not as a traditional horror."
0, The first train wreck of 2014 is a labor of incompetence not even Hercules' strength can overcome.
0, This star-laden action drama is proof that more money and gizmos do not necessarily make for a bigger thrill ride... a picture that has plenty of crash and bang but little in the way of emotional wallop.
1," [A]s is typical, the filmmaker's arguments are thought-provoking, even when they are wrapped in indecency. "
1, Real-life friends Diggs and Casal must have less of an unstable dynamic than their characters; the two actors wrote Blindspotting together and perform a potentially fraught duet as its leads.
0," Both Parineeti and Arjun are in need of a hit and to that end they try hard to spice up the proceedings. However, their heroic efforts aren't enough to salvage the disjointed story and screenplay."
1," Ultimately, this is just a big, dumb, commercial suspenser - but it's one of the best for ages, reminding us that it is still possible to make a high quality piece of popcorn entertainment."
0," Hoary slapstick routines, invariably rushed, are all there is in The Pink Panther 2."
0," Defiance makes a noise but leaves no echo. It feels progressively more bogus and less significant the further it recedes from view, and myths are meant to wax in the memory, not wane."
0," That's an intriguing question about life and fate, albeit one this film - about a chance discovery setting off an old vendetta - doesn't fully see through."
1, The wickedly entertaining characters and actors each leave audiences in stitches as they go through the motions of an equally entertaining--albeit redone--plot that will thrill die-hard fans of the original.
1, May be the best mob movie in years that was made by somebody whose name is not Scorsese or Coppola.
1,"It doesn't have a brain in its head, but it's made with skill and style and, boy, is it fast and furious."
1," Great to see Douglas back in the role that won him an Oscar. But even when he's offscreen, he's a bigger presence than LaBeouf."
1, The justly-famous closing image is one of the most baffling and incongruous climaxes in a genre known and celebrated by devotees for its WTF factor.
1," Climax ends up being a lot harder to easily shake off or dismiss through an ironic remove. If you can stomach Noé's worst tendencies, this one will stick with you."
0, One feels that Stenders tried to create an Australian version of a Quentin Tarantino film while forgetting to add the snappy dialogue or the colourful characters.
1," Armadillo alternates between scenes of tedium on base and wildly dangerous raids, with the inadvertent effect that viewers get hungry for a little combat to alleviate the monotony."
0, No reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously didn't invest much into itself either.
0," ...while the stigma of skin color starts to fade in time for the film to make its statement on different worlds (from race to gender to class) relating and bonding over what they have in common, it's just a bit too late."
1," Not only the finest animated movie ever made, but deserves a prominent position on any list of all-time greats."
0," [Shyamalan] hasn't lost his eye as a director, but the story is a mess, boring at first and then becoming progressively sillier until it loses complete credibility."
1, A film that's just as thrilling and fast-paced as the book.
0," In Jackson's simplified, sweetened, and  CGI-besotted telling, The Lovely Bones is a sad-but-hopeful, dramatic-but-gentle fairy tale intentionally made less upsetting for teens."
1,"Not only its a hysterically raunchy and jaw dropping comedy, but manages to have food for thought with a risky theme that you don't see in many films."
0, The kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea.
1, One of the great strengths of CSNY is how skillfully it deflects criticism of 'four balding hippie millionaires' taking to the stage to criticize American politics; the film is peppered with excerpts from some of the tour's earliest and nastiest critics.
1," Darwin's Nightmare is an urgent, horrific, yet at times oddly blinkered vision of the crisis of modern Africa."
1," First-time feature filmmaker John Maclean takes a strikingly original approach to the Western, creating a realistic road trip for two very different men."
1," It revives the pleasant art of storytelling most of today's young filmmakers have all but abandoned, and cures (temporarily, anyway) my allergy to Adam Sandler."
0," It's an E-ticket ride. But in the end, there's no heart, no moral to this story. And for all our sweat as viewers, the one thing we crave by Crank's closing credits is detox."
0," The visceral thrill of experience Petit's death-defying feat is undeniable, but Zemeckis pushes the envelope farther than it needs to go and makes some highly questionable decisions that undermine what is best in the film."
0, So generic and derivative...that it's hard to turn your brain off and even enjoy the action. 
1, The best movie of the year so far.
0," This is a film that can only be watched in utter misery. See it, and share in cinema's degradation."
1," Crazy Stupid Love is funnier, smarter and more touching than your average cut-out-andkeep Hollywood relationship flick."
0," The characters may speak English, but the narrative is gibberish."
0,By-the-book Hollywood remake.
1," The result is a low-key mind-bender that feels half-scripted, half improvised, and -- for the most part -- rather surprisingly compelling."
0," It isn't funny; it isn't touching; there's a screamingly annoying and supercilious voiceover-narration, and all its dramatic ideas are bafflingly unfinished and unresolved."
0, All too bloodless.
0," With nobody to play against except her own bad self, even Maleficent is more of a striking objet d'art than a character. "
0, Babel is supposed to be a cry of humanist anguish that echoes -- in four languages -- around the world. Why does it feel as much like an elaborate game of middlebrow post-millennial Clue?
0," The painstaking set-up for the heist is both admirable in its detail and off-putting in the slick way it exploits poverty, reducing social drama to a genre gimmick."
0," While the initial premise and high school setting show promise, the film quickly devolves into a series of obnoxious jump scares and routine storytelling."
0, A movie that has the haranguing inspirational tone of a marathon Sunday-school lesson.
0," Two of the world's best actors, Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva, play Amour's octogenarian couple, so it's surprising that the characters aren't very interesting."
0, Lame and lifeless.
1," The fun and excitement of Captain America: Civil War carries it through a slow start and weak premise. It sets up great expectations for new chapters, and after this epic fracturing of their Avengers friendship, we want to know where they go from here."
1," This is a quiet movie, which never loses its focus on its central character study, while allowing points about economic and social inequalities to sound out loud and clear."
1,Croatian-born director-writer Goran Dukic instills Wristcutters with the absurdist humor you find in films from the Balkans.
0, More offensive than the disgusting attempts at humor is the utter contempt for the audience in every lazy and incompetent frame and line of dialogue.
0, Get the Girl never moves far beyond the shallow waters of post-modern deconstruction.
1," One of the most memorable, intense experiences in recent memory."
1," The movie is dour, and poignant, and dour, and poetic, and dour. But the positives outweigh the negatives, and it does end with a glimmer of hope among the gloom."
0," The more preachy and pious the film becomes, the more muddled and unexciting it starts to feel."
0," Also about a demanding public physical activity, Darren Aronofsky's pretentious 'Black Swan' is a giant step down from 'The Wrestler.'"
0, The story is loaded with cliches and weak characters that are simply too annoying to handle. 
0, That disgusting wet noise is an audience of eyes rolling skyward in unison.
1, Exiled veers on the pretentious ...but the whole thing has such a humor about itself that it's hard to carp about it.
1," In terms of the action genre, American Assassin gives you everything you'd want out of this type of film, including explosions, car chases, and tightly choreographed fight sequences. "
1," Off-screen Mel Gibson may be a deplorable human being, but he and The Beaver, a film honest about depression and lined with a certain bruised grace, are uniquely suited to one another."
1, We're constantly kept on our toes regarding issues of representation while Pekar's sour but indefatigible working-class skepticism carries us along.
1," This is a great and ultimately humanizing look at one of the most stunning achievements of our time, one that not only deserves to be seen but which cries out to be seen on the biggest screen imaginable. "
1, This breathless thriller that treats the speed of data as a matter of life and death.
0," Rango was crafty enough to extend an olive branch to adult viewers. Rio is strictly for the kids, and anyone expecting this Brazilian-set film to contain any references to City of God (or, heck, even The Boys from Brazil) will be sorely disappointed."
1," A dark and relentless thriller, with every character frayed by the realities of life and relationships. "
1, Does Andrew Stanton's film amount to much more than a brilliant aesthetic exercise? I'm not convinced it does.
1," It's one from the heart, and a twisted tale it is."
1," Sequels will come and go, and it might be some time before Hollywood throws this much money and this much prestige at a franchise staple like this. But at least we have this movie for now. "
0, A film of distinguished performances that rise above a coincidence-riddled and perfunctory screenplay -- without redeeming it.
0," A post-apocalyptic children's fable that recalls the pre-Amelie work of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Fritz Lang's Metropolis and Pixar's Wall-E, City of Ember is a production designer's movie that retains some of the fairy-tale darkness of the Grimm"
1," Rodrigues completely changes his accustomed record of turbid atmospheres and dark characters marked by fatality, to propose, in the form of a luminous parable, the experience of his solitary protagonist. [Full review in Spanish]"
1," You've heard this song before and can predict all the emotional high notes before they hit, but sometimes that's all you need from a summer bop."
1," I'll admit, I've always had a hard time with rape-revenge thrillers... but [Revenge] asks us to look deeper, especially in the behaviour of women which is often considered worthy of blame when there should be none."
1,"The first half of this film is great entertainment, and then it starts to unravel, but not before Chan establishes himself as a dynamic comedian."
1, ...a film that reminds us of the limitations of snap judgements.
0," As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries."
1, Without doubt Lake Bodom is one of the best entries from recent years into the canon.
1,"A fun, insightful and sensuous romp through a world in which few of us have traveled."
0, So monotonously repetitive that you'll forget penises were ever supposed to be funny in the first place.
1," From Afar is an intriguing, emotionally painful and brilliant film."
1, What it doesn't have: the adrenaline rush of total and complete surprise. 
1," In its own, weird way it resonates, even after a story that some will see as silly and an ending that teeters on gimmicky."
1," If ""Primer"" was a Rubik's Cube, ""Upstream Color"" is a poem or a half-remembered dream -- or, more accurately, a nightmare."
1,Unbearable tension is coupled with wit and the consistent element of surprise.
0," Del Toro has a whopper of a story on his hands, but his unique storytelling sensibility feels muffled by the demands of genre contrivances and a bigger-is-better aesthetic."
0, The start is promising and the chimerical idealism of the protagonists is contagious but ends up diluting in a routine and predictable marital confrontation. [Full review in Spanish]
0, Very violent honest-cop corruption story.
0," The film is polite when it should be wicked -- it's melodrama that thinks it's saving lives, like it drank too much chardonnay"
1, This well-designed and executed piece of entertainment is actually very satisfying.
1," Supplies a happy ration of kid-friendly slapstick, grown-up jokes, and a batch of the most recognizable actors in Britain."
0, Stick a fork in the Rugrats movie franchise. It's done.
1," The effort is wonderfully suspenseful and exhaustively mysterious, but the true grip of tension is founded in procedural behaviors, gifting the film a striking realism that makes it superior to the average B-movie. "
1, Decent teen scare that goes all the way. It's pretty fun when the writer doesn't seem to have limits. [Full review in Spanish].
1, It remains pretty damn powerful even if some of its thunder has been slightly stolen by the mighty army of war movies that have come before.
1," Anchored by Jennifer Lawrence's performance, Red Sparrow is a slow-burn spy/seductress thriller that's shiny on the surface, yet lacking in depth."
1, The matter is settled; the filmed Hamlet of Laurence Olivier gives absolute proof that these classics are magnificiently suited to the screen.
0," Despite the talent involved, The Light Between Oceans is mawkish when it should be moving."
1," A beautifully written, effectively acted, and meticulously crafted effort."
0,"Will Smith, Fourth of July, superhero. It all seems to add up to a great combination. But they only made half a film."
0," After its bracing opening, the film begins to indulge the worst impulses of well-meaning liberal cinema."
0," I thought the film silly if endearing. Fluff noir. Others, peering into the crystal, see and prophesy a cult future for filmmaker Alain Guiraudie."
1, What a fun and thrilling summertime romp
1," Still working the Miyazaki playbook, if not quite with the maestro's level of expertise."
1," Bae Chang-ho, in essence, directs a film about love, although not in the way the sentiment is usually portrayed in cinema, but instead as a destructive force that leads people to extremes, clouding their mind and ruining their lives."
1," This isn't a typically dumbed-down rehash and, as such, it dissatisfied the rank and file of multiplex moviegoers but earned the appreciation of adventurous film fans."
0, There's wonderful potential for permanently bleached out vistas to embody a metaphorical emptiness. Here it's just a great big blank.
0," A crime drama about a family of cops discovering corruption in its ranks--co-written, directed and produced by two sons of cops. You're bound to come up with something very muscular, even if it's entirely derivative."
0," While The Women provides an evening of laughter and some points to ponder, relationships work only when all involved are willing to sacrifice for one another."
1," The moral is not too original, but the offbeat characters certainly are."
0," The first half of writer/director Rian Johnson's film is gripping, but by the second half it's all become unbelievably confused and disjointed."
0," If you must see one of the two Presidential daughter movies - this is the one to see. But like Chasing Liberty, it never delivers on the potential of the premise. "
0," The movie attempts to jerk tears with one clunky device after another, in a plot that is a perfect storm of cliche and contrivance."
0,"Here is the biggest, fattest, dampest squib of the week: perhaps the most disappointing film ever to have won the Golden Bear at the Berlin film festival."
0, So clumsy and crass that it makes you doubt the pleasure of the first movie.
1, nice but a little overrated; it's all holly
1, Anyone who enjoyed the original will enjoy spending a little more time with Joe and his band of merry weirdos.
1," If all of Ellis's characters more or less stay the same, Harron's film suggests that, like the '80s, Bateman to shall pass."
0," Typical of such compilations, results tend to vary wildly."
1," The restrained script from Sachs and co-writer Mauricio Zacharias takes these boys seriously, without one whiff of condescension, and places value in life's mundane miracles, like forgiveness and the love of a true friend."
1," With its mix of neo-Western and quasi-samurai tropes, Logan isn't just the best X-Men movie in forever; it's one of the best comic-book-sourced movies we've seen in some time."
1," As uncompromising as all his work and, though beautifully and often breathtakingly shot by fellow director Fred Keleman, is definitely not for the faint-hearted."
1," [Actor Alfred] Castro, giving Robert De Niro a run for his money, has taken the anti-hero to an insidious extreme."
1," Rich, creative Western with much to say about politics and gender."
0," Continues the trend of R-rated comedies mixing serious don't-bring-grandma vulgarity with totally unironic, all-stops-out sweetness and sentimentality."
1," When the end comes, it feels too soon... a classic set-em-up, knock-em-down overkill horror as fans like it."
1," Cornish raises the stakes and the emotional investment of the characters, making Attack the Block more effective in all of the different genres its trying to pull off at the same time."
0, Inferno is a strained attempt to capitalise on Robert Langdon's popularity and a far cry from the fast-paced and edge-of-the-seat stuff we have come to expect from the Brown-Howard-Hanks combine.
0, Let's forget the fact that the demon killed everyone in the town in the first film because obviously the filmmakers did.
0," Based on the well-known novel 'The Eagle of the Ninth,' 'The Eagle' is a serviceable movie about the importance of honor and allegiance in ancient Rome."
1,"If Crowe's films radiate one thing, it's kindness, which is something not a lot of filmmakers can claim."
0,"Doom isn't doomed, but the movie doesn't let loose and really rock until its final third."
0," Every shred of true story credence becomes lost in a flurry of facepalm-worthy character decisions, headache-inducing edits and stupid, preposterous action."
1," As a performance showcase it's intriguing simply because Eenhoorn and Nelson barely belong to the same species, so different are they in demeanor."
1," Director Matt Tyrnauer gives Studio 54 its due with a straightforward talking head/archival clips doc, but manages to inject fresh insight thanks to an extensive interview with co-owner Ian Schrager."
1,"Call Me by Your Name is more invitingly heartfelt and less baroque than the director's previous films, and skillfully captures ... the languor of the summer mood."
0,"Close is magnetic, accepting an acting experiment with a thrilling fearlessness and devotion to complete immersion. If only the rest of the production matched her grace and concentration."
0," So much movie, I think my engorged eyeballs had to stick a finger down their throats and vomit out a couple of epic battle scenes just so they could get through the finale."
0," This somber cousin of My Week With Marilyn could really do with more ruminations on acting, on and off stage, and fewer on the ravages of terminal illness."
0," ""The Help'' comes out on the losing end of the movies' social history. The best film roles three black women will have all year require one of them to clean Ron Howard's daughter's house. It's self-reinforcing movie imagery."
0," ...the film is mildly diverting, even if it's a ""Jagged Edge"" (1985) wannabe and wears its manifold cliches on its sleeve."
1," If you enjoyed the first LEGO Movie, then you will certainly be along for the ride for The Second Part. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0," Furry Vengeance is unbearable. (Actually, the bear's performance is pretty good.)"
1," Employing a suitably chiaroscuro film language to balance the emotional extremes of the subject matter, his vision is a lively composite of urban nightmare and garish escapism."
1," It's a thoroughly exhaustive, hand-wringing emotional stick of provincial dynamite that viciously grabs the audience by the collar and drags them through the gummy muck of lives gone horribly wrong."
1," Think of the film 'Catch Me If You Can' meets 'Ocean's Eleven' with a twist. The jewelry thief is an unsuspecting, sweet, and gorgeous Black woman by the name of Doris Payne."
1, An eye-pricklingly subtle chronicle of a young boy coming to terms with the reality that his single mom is dying.
0," While watching Werner Herzog's My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done you might be tempted to murmur, ""My Werner, My Werner, What Have Ye Done."""
1," It's a film of climates: at times that atmosphere is successful, and in others slowness is imposed and the tedium dulls the dramatic tension. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Without the ambition to ever do anything more, Justice is a lacklustre, low-grade thriller that you'd be disappointed by had it not set its standards so cripplingly low."
1," A teen comedy for the Facebook generation. It acknowledges all the new technology teens have at their disposal, but it's not all about social media."
1, The ferociously one-dimensional characters here make this muddy ramble more of a guilty pleasure than a success.
0, At the end of the story the young men rebel against discipline and use the stock cars to attack and destroy many of the wooden buildings in the town. I looked for symbolism here and failed to find it.
0, Like watching someone channel-surf through five video game boss battles at the same time. 
1," You'll admire the doggie tricks and tolerate the rest, which is both the best and worst thing that can be said about it."
0," Honestly, all the big draws to the film were the biggest letdowns of it for me."
0," What started out as cheeky fun ripens into black humor, and then overripens into an oppressive gilding of the lilles that stink."
0, makes me wonder if an Easter Bunny movie isn't just around the corner
0," The first couple of acts of the Kendricks' latest, ""War Room,"" are so heavy on broad pulpit pounding that it's challenging to get swept along by the story's message."
1," ""The second feature film by Ruizpalacios does not match the humor or the inventiveness of his extraordinary opera prima Güeros (2014), although it is not exactly a failure either""."
1," Singleton was only 23 when he made this urgent state-of-the-nation drama. But his skill with the camera, handling of actors, and raw dialogue suggests a seasoned pro."
0," Born out of a desire to explain the seemingly inexplicable, the Ouija board remains enigmatic."
0," Well-intentioned, but teeth-grindingly earnest, with a voice-over that seems to consist entirely of clichés."
1," Whether you're among the 46,520 Kickstarter contributors or an avowed member of the anti-Braff brigade, you may just find yourself trying to stifle a sniffle."
1, Esposito channels the kind of righteous fury that can only come from someone who's been through hell and clawed her way back
0, ... a real disaster. [Full review in Spanish]
0,The movie proves to be no more enjoyable than the resultant enormous phone bill.
0," ""The Five-Year Engagement"" becomes two things: an accurate reflection of a new generation of postponement-prone 30-somethings, and a rather uninteresting story."
0, Much of the dialogue for this terminally mawkish tearjerker sounds as if it has been taken directly from a Dolly Parton or Whitney Houston song.
0," And so it was, and so it was dull, the greatest villain in all cinema bitten on the neck and drained of his hottest blood."
0," ""The weirdest love stories are the best,"" says Hirsch's doomed poet-warrior. ""Twice Born"" isn't weird enough to be half-good."
0, The story is a confusing bore that leads achingly slowly to a solution as perfunctory as it is implausible.
1, Damon's minimalist style is key to why the Bourne movies have become an oasis from other blockbuster action fare; freed from the bells and whistles of computer-generated effects...and they've succeeded in bringing the genre back down to earth.
1," Despite all the special effects and stunts, it is the character development and the nice way the three principal actors work together that makes the film effective."
0," A total dud, as well as perhaps the worst sequel to appear in this up-and-down summer movie season."
1, ...one of Hitchcock's most-successful screen works and an easy recommendation for any DVD library.
0, Its sole claim to fame may turn out to be as the most slyly foul-mouthed children's film yet made.
1, ...a classic bit of '70s filmmaking.
0, The comic effect goes limp fast and has little to do with the effort of Segel's Pete to win back the girlfriend of the title (Kristen Bell).
0, Teeming with amazing shots there's no denying that Andrea Arnold has a wonderful eye - but these visual delights are not enough to hold this lengthy and ultimately tedious film together.
1,"It's almost impossible not to be moved by Jim Caviezel's vulnerability as Christ, even if the idea that he is no 'mere' man is never in doubt."
1, This is aiming for an old school Attenborough modus operandi and isn't far off at all.
1," While not all the tales come alive, more hit than miss, bringing gore and menace in October, but reveling in the iconography of December. "
1,A well made film that left me emotionally cold.
1,Don Siegel's excellent heist/escape movie makes an interesting juxtaposition to his Clint Eastwood films.
1, Gritty yet surprisingly touching story.
0," Mostly, it makes you feel like the only sober person at a party you can't leave."
0, Becomes disastrously bogged down in an interminable second act that is joyless and inert and from which it doesn’t begin to recover for over an hour.
0, It feels like an uncomfortable parade of Borscht belt gags and lame stereotypes.
0,The main problem with Coach Carter can be summed up simply: too much sermonizing.
1, the rotund baseball cap wearing 'everyman' filmmaker adds a grand sequel to his resume
1, There's tons of weird stuff here.
1, The great virtue of Offside is that it never degenerates into an us-versus-them situation. [Director Pahani] understands that a repressive system victimizes the oppressors as much as the oppressed.
1," Not about what its characters say, but what what they say says about them."
0, Despite its surface sheen the picture is really nothing more than a high-toned soap opera straining to pass for a work of art.
0,...isn't so much a bad movie as an unfinished movie
0," While not as emotionally resonating and insightful as other classroom dramas such as Freedom Writers or as captivating as Dangerous Minds, at least it's mildly compelling, quietly moving and consistently true-to-life."
0, ...the wheeling and dealing of Getaway is all too familiar in its wasted gas-guzzle gumption of throwaway excitement and stimulation... it cannot change the fact that it has hit a creative speed bump...and in a worst way possible.
0," Anything good that can be said about this movie tends to be hindered by the ugly animation, which pales in comparison to anything else being done in the field right now."
0," A flat and uninspiring slasher flick from the ""Scream"" age that just misses on every level."
0," That Costner's antihero should be so fundamentally dislikable is entirely acceptable - after all, the Mariner's arc makes him an eternal outsider... - but that he should also be deadly dull is less so"
1," In this extremely talky movie, the most eloquent line is a primal scream."
1, Blowin' Up winds up being a powerful ode to a sanctuary city.
0," The sequel Machete Kills opens with a fake trailer for a not-yet-produced third installment, then spends the next 100-plus minutes making a case for plunging a knife into the franchise's heart."
1," A comical, lively watch with a deeper implication, Ocean's 8 should justify to everyone that the industry no longer needs the likes of a Clooney, Pitt, and Damon equivalent team to carry a big blockbuster spectacle."
1," Gratuitous male nudity? A man-child hero with a heart of gold? R-rated comedy high jinks? Yup, producer Judd Apatow is back on track with the hilarious Forgetting Sarah Marshall"
1," If I was 10 years old, GI Joe would be one of the best movies I had ever seen. As a grown up it's one of the better summer movies; a delightfully light, fun and action-packed kick in the ass."
0," Please, folks, unless you feel like there is nothing left for you in this world and want to end it all, avoid this film at all costs."
0," Money may never sleep, but Oliver Stone's return to the setting of his 1987 hit 'Wall Street' gets soporific pretty quickly."
1, There's a lot of emotion and heart.
0, ... a low-budget mix of frights and laughs that fails to be consistently scary or funny.
1," The politics are relegated to the background, and what is left is a commercially astute weepie."
1," The Spiderwick Chronicles is fast, funny, and clever, with memorable creatures to sweeten the deal."
1," From shooting in the dormitories at night to recording in the homes of teachers, filmmaker Neasa Ní Chianáin and her partner and co-director, David Rane, have really managed to get an all-access pass to the school."
0," More irksome is the ordained focus on plot undulation and simplistic motivation, as if nobody remembered that the first film was a social satire."
0," [M]y good Mr. Fanboy, I give you G.I Joe: The Rise of Cobra, the world's first weaponized movie!"
1," ... somewhat unsteadily balances a cute, getting-to-know-you budding respect between two tentative lovers and the raw ravages of survival, which includes cougars, thin ice and deep snow... "
0," Hollywood is full of liars, back-stabbers, sycophants, would-be power players and rampant egomaniacs. And your point is what?"
1," It's not an enjoyable watch but it's well made, authentic-feeling and very powerful thanks to fine performances from a cast led by Mrunal Thakur."
1," A preachy but gripping socio-political thriller...directed by Fernando Meirelles with the same unblinking, sweaty, ground-level grittiness he brought to City of God."
1," I Am Number Four"" is entertaining and worth checking out for the action scenes alone."
0," When a small drama sputters to life at the end, it's too late. You've already been lulled into dreamland."
1," Bay, never one for subtlety, cranks up the sentimentality in his most patriotic film to date."
1, A touch of class and sweet sophistication with a brilliantly funny cast. Definitely an indie sleeper worth checking out.
1," Meditation on sex, life, death; older teens only."
0,"Well...I've seen worse. And that's about the only recommendation I can make for ""Doom,"" yet another movie that's based on a video game."
1,"An undeniably creepy, unnerving experience that turns mundane things -- a refrigerator door, a ringing telephone, TV static -- into moments of terrific suspense."
0," Greenaway provides a visual feast, then he kills your appetite."
0, It's often so straightforward and celebratory that it lacks the rebellious spirit of its uniquely talented subject.
0," ""American Anarchist"" makes for unsatisfying viewing, although it's possible it couldn't have been otherwise."
0," Jeanette purposely evokes old peasant passion plays, amateur theatre, or perhaps less kindly, school nativity plays devised by head teachers longing to prove religion can be cool."
1," Eventually wants to posit the ironic enthusiasm of The Room's midnight-movie fandom as a kind of ""validating moment"" for Wiseau and company - in effect, congratulating its makers and stars for being fans of The Room."
1," When it works, it's outstanding. And when it doesn't, it's good enough."
1," Though there's certainly a little fat around the edges-the film doesn't skimp on laughs amidst all the scares-it's a small price to pay for the truly galvanizing finale, in which three generations of Strode women throw down against the boogeyman. "
1," Though it's likely to divide viewers pro and con, the fact that it attempts to do something different, defying easy categorization in the process, itself makes it worth seeing despite its flaws."
0," Should we require a satire of misogynistic violence executed in the name of creation, we do not need it from Aronofsky, who is all extremes, no nuance."
0, Kasdan's film could've just been any generic survivalist action-comedy; slapping the board game onto the title is nothing but shameless branding.
0," Less a movie, more a ragbag of 80's pop cultural references hung on a storyline."
1, Director David Slade keeps the action brisk and the time-killing attractive ... All of which should be like a freshly opened vein for fans.
1," Where few movies even contemplate delivering an experience this glorious, The Two Towers is uncompromising and unmissable."
0," Although the intent is clearly to create a somewhat disorienting visual experience, it's the consistently derivative plotline that's really at issue."
1," Beautifully shot, lit and framed, featuring completely believable performances from its two young leads."
1, My Joy is a challenge to watch but hard to forget.
0, Smith's bottomless capacity for charm saves the movie from itself.
1," One of those genre-defying hybrids that are sometimes called dramedies, The Savages tiptoes along a particularly fraught emotional tightrope, balancing observant humor and deep sadness with uncommon grace."
0," An efficient enough legal potboiler...But Hoblit set the bar high with Primal Fear, and this attempted follow-up, though mildly engaging, doesn't quite clear it."
0," The movie ignores the rule of three, instead repeating its best jokes just enough for them to funny the second time around. Unfortunately, MacGruber's best jokes are few and far between."
0,"dusty jokes about Mama Cass and Karen Carpenter -- how's that for topical humor? ... Unfortunately, most of the funny moments in 'Man' come when the film is playing it straight"
0," A revolting gross-out comedy, whose humor is witless, scatological and childish."
1," The director, Alex Kurtzman, jolly well keeps things moving, so that even when nothing in the film made much sense, I was reasonably caught up in the ridiculousness."
1, An idiosyncratic salute to an indomitable human spirit.
1, Don't let this slip by you.
1," The settings are moody and evocative, the script is well crafted and thought-provoking and there are really cool action sequences with guns, knives and roses... U for unexpectedly good."
1,"Faithful hardcore genre fans will find much to like here among the cloaks and daggers.... On the other hand, the pacing is slow and the twisty, sometimes flabby script might be frustrating for a viewer not fully engaged with such skullduggery."
1," The film-makers' undisguised glee in the revolting catalogue of horrors is a delight to behold, and the sense of naked misanthropy is queasily invigorating throughout."
1,"It's not an easy film of righteousness, but a trembling drama, with more venom than anticipated, salvaged by a few outstanding performances. "
0," It remains a puny little amateur-night rip-off of Sex and the City, without the saucy wit or sharply-drawn personalities."
0," Over-produced, over-publicized, over-designed, over-computerized and just plain over the moon, it's so preposterously overwrought with so many bewildering plots juggling simultaneously for over-emphasis, there's no entry point for criticism."
1," Takes on a whole different level of realism with Bale, pathetically gaunt yet heroically charismatic, nailing Dicky's double edged nature."
1," The sepia tones and the claustrophobic camerawork are instantly recognizable as Sokurov's work, and so is the emphasis on family intimacy."
1," Alycia Delmore gives a nuanced performance as Anna, but it's the dumb-as-stumps performances from Duplass and Leonard that make ""Humpday"" a movie that you can laugh at as much as you laugh with it."
1," 'Captain Marvel' flies high and fast, but struggles with narrative turbulence."
0," Leprechaun: Origins isn't just bad - it's downright insulting. Lipovski's film is nothing but a series of bad choices, worse execution and infuriating redundancy, highlighting the ugliness that comes along with exploiting horror instead of respecting it."
1,It is an impressive movie masquerading as an important one.
1," The Eyes of My Mother is the rare [horror] entry to give depth to its destructive force, to force those new eyes onto us and make us truly believe the terror of what we see."
1," Taking a cold, cruel plunge into its sociopath's world, Winterbottom's latest genre swerve is an accomplished neo-noir."
0," All we really get is a Chainsaw that sputters before it splatters, leaving the sleepy audience anxious to saw logs."
0, The kind of comedy that you'll forget mere moments after seeing.
0," While Dolan's previous film Mommy (2014) was hailed a masterpiece, somehow his follow-up, for me at least, doesn't live up to that kind of hype. It's not exactly surprising that the critical reaction so far has been mixed to say the least."
1, ... unapologetic piece of B-movie termite art...
0," You can tell Miley Cyrus is trying to show her character is filled with dramatic, painful agony because she scrunches up her face like a Cabbage Patch Doll (or Renee Zellweger)."
0," This likable, lackadaisical comedy proves more focused than the first film yet lacks much of its comic bite."
0," It's enough to make you cry. Equally, it might make you laugh. Daniels is a director who would find it hard to imagine puddings can be over-egged, or that Monty Python's 'We're So Poor' sketch was meant to be funny."
0," ""Prepare the Animus?"" I thought she said, ""Prepare the enemas."" Given the film, it makes more sense."
0," The real sinful hex at large that some unsuspecting moviegoers will ultimately suffer is succumbing to the laughable supernatural spell that The Last Witch Hunter will cast in insufferable, confusing fashion."
1," It's about as beautifully simple and lithe as an epic visual feast can get, with Ghibli-esque themes about our spiritual connection to nature kept high in the mix, and an overarching bittersweetness that keeps the fantasy grounded in human emotion."
0,"In Jonah Hex, Josh Brolin plays a Wild West bounty hunter who can talk to dead people. So how come he couldn't yank the film's director out of his coma?"
1, Delves into a little-known facet in the life of the iconic leader with an intimacy that is both stark and engrossing.
0," The movie's impersonal, conventional telling of a reasonably standard male coming-of-age story almost tends to make the punk milieu it depicts beside the point."
1," Mary Elizabeth Winstead is eminently relatable in a compassionate, human-scaled movie of the sort that movies have almost forgotten of late."
0," ""Show, don't tell,"" the old saying goes. ""Triple 9"" does neither."
0, Dispiritingly conventional and obvious.
1," The Endless goes places both eerily unexpected and emotionally affecting, the all-encompassing monstrous beauty of this spellbinding sci-fi thriller impossible to understate."
0, Watchmen left me looking at the exit far more often than at the screen.
0," While Stallone and De Niro have no difficulty proving they can still muster a decent right hook, it's the punch lines they have some trouble landing"
0," For all its impressive dialogue and exemplary performances, Fences left me...well...on the fence. "
1," The magic of Kiki is the girl's sense of wonder in her new world, whether it's her soaring flight among the migrating geese or a bicycle ride... to see the dirigible."
0," Franco wants to have his cake and eat it too, openly mocking Wiseau for his weirdness, then heralding him for his persistence and ability to embrace The Room's reputation. "
0, Merchant-Ivory at their dullest.
1, Ideally mindless and entertaining in every way.
1," Watching this again, I am less inclined to regard Nurse Ratched as a simple villain, despite her vindictive humiliation of poor, shy Billy, and more like a professional who refuses to be bullied by a bunch of men."
1," A fun-filled flick with an all-star cast having a blast; Ocean's 8 is a stylish follow-up that captures the spirit of the original trilogy while still doing its own thing. Fans of celebrities, crime capers and Cate Blanchett in suits will love this."
1, The way [Ridley] Scott meticulously raises the sense of menace and tension is worthy of Hitchcock.
1," Modernized take on a classic has a few laughs -- and, more importantly, a heart in the right place."
0," Dafoe crackles with an electric instability ... but the film itself presents no new information, nor offers any particularly fresh interpretation of Van Gogh or his work."
0, A deeper glimpse of the San Diego indie-rock scene around him might have made Brook's self-absorbed resentment less overbearing.
1," It's good the film exposes his methods, especially with the final stretch of our current election cycle upon us."
0," The odds are even that reaction to the twist, when it comes, will be huh! Or duh. Or whaaaa?"
1," McQueen packs his film with so much identifiable humanity you'll leave sore. Watching 12 Years is a grueling experience, and the artistry of the filmmakers and actors is a generous, pain-diminishing life raft."
1," Its world is cruel and chaotic, but it unfolds with purpose and grace."
0, A B-movie science-fiction melodrama that really needed the genius of David Cronenberg to bring it to life.
0," For a movie with so much heart, ""Queen of the Desert"" is a remarkably bloodless enterprise."
1, An intriguing and emotional journey with some fine performances all around.
0," Making a parable out of the Holocaust is a dicey proposition, and here the emotional tugs are so forced that it exploits and trivializes the historical tragedy it claims to be trying to illuminate."
0," Garner makes the most of her chance to shine here ... Mark Ruffalo is also charming, and it's their sweetness that gives this otherwise ho-hum flick any distinction."
1," What this rough-around-the-edges but hugely likeable film lacks in budget it more than makes up for in energy, visual flair and, yes, punk spirit."
1, Paul Verhoeven's target in Black Book is extremists on both sides of the political equation
1," There are a dozen dwarves, and they all have names that sound like power tools, and their motivation ... well, let's just call them the Ferengi of Middle Earth."
0," A totally abysmal MIDNIGHT RUN rip-off, only salvaged by okay fight choreography and some nifty location shooting. "
0," Roach and screenwriter John McNamara's approach is leaden, thumping and pushing viewers to its themes instead of letting them come organically."
0," Yet, for all the film's stylishness and a body count worthy of a small civil war, there's no getting around the fact that stiff, stoic Reeves -- who is capable of a few funny, deadpan lines -- isn't a particularly compelling lead action figure."
0," Rudyard Kipling, on whose book all this is based, managed to have his name taken off the credits from beyond the grave, proving that in death he has a savvier agent than those responsible for this script."
1," This movie often plays like a super-expensive, 21st-century version of one of those ""Star Wars"" knockoffs made around 1980 by people who weren't George Lucas."
0, The animation is vibrant and the voice cast impressive... So it's a great shame that the animators and actors are let down by the meandering plot and trite dialogue.
1, Dano presents a secure directorial command. [Full Review in Spanish]
1," It does at least float a few ideas worth discussing, and it's kept interesting by the powerful performances of Channing and Stiles."
1," [Paddington 2] has one out-loud laugh, plenty of sincere cleverness, vast technical ingenuity, a warm heart, lively performances and enough gyroscopic camera moves to make Max Ophüls jealous."
0," As with countless films set in the period, the absence of subtlety combined with predictable dollops of sentimentalism once again trivialize events in the name of making them understandable."
1," Thoroughbreds was written and directed by first-time filmmaker Cory Finley, and for other amateurs it's a masterclass in squeezing everything you can out of a small budget."
1, A thought-provoking and very entertaining ride driven by [Helen] Mirren's uncompromising performance.
0," The Brothers Grimm has its moments, but it's ultimately a very flawed film and capsizes under the weight of some hammy performances and a poorly-conceived script. "
1," It has been a long time since a movie has lingered with me as long as Life of Pi, a strikingly beautiful parable about strength, survival and spirituality."
1, An interesting film in the career of a Mexican filmmaker that we have to follow. [Full review in Spanish]
1," [A] touching, gripping and beautifully paced film..."
0," This is frankly disposable entertainment, but to some degree it's a welcome parody of earnest superhero movies like those directed by Christopher Nolan, which for all their self-importance are fundamentally just as silly. "
0," The sad truth is that we've heard countless harrowing stories of the Holocaust, and this one, for the most part, isn't presented in a way that makes it indelible or urgent."
1," Through Kostanski & Gillespie's inspirations and vision, they have crafted a work with The Void that serves as a decent blueprint for where to take their craft next."
1," Between the stellar cast, likable characters and the engaging script, there is plenty here to like."
0," An imbecilic and unnecessary restaging of the original, this time onboard a train."
0, The remake neither pays perceptive tribute to the original nor updates it in anything but hackneyed form.
0, Pleasant but easily forgettable. [Full Review in Spanish]
0, Nap time for adults.
0," Despite Palmer's committed performance and Shortland's attempt to make a genre film that looks great and is deep, Berlin Syndrome is dull, overlong, and unfocused."
1," In the end, this isn't just a story about one family fractured by the Holocaust, but about the German nurse and the South African kindergarten teacher who would affect the trajectory of the clan. "
1," Set in rural Arkansas, Jeff Nichols' relaxed, distinctive debut revels in the milieu of its redneck characters, but injects their rural half-blood feud with an almost mythic quality."
1, Tells a supremely clever and involving story. Which is also moving.
1," ""Button"" ends up being an eloquent and moving tale that keeps all its lighter and darker elements in near-perfect balance."
1," ... for those who warm to [director Jérȏme] Reybaud's cinematic rhythm will find ""Four Days in France"" to be one of the best gay films in years."
0," Reitman clearly wants to get at something human in his films - connection, family, humanity - but he lacks the artistic tools to explore those things; a man stabbing at the stony soil of an archaeological dig with only a Q-tip to uncover its wonders."
0," Elle Fanning is serviceable, but left undone by a story that doesn't give Mary an arc so much as a linear, Wikipedia style journey through her life."
1," Tom Hanks was born to play ""Sully."""
0," Like previous robot hitman films, this one also sucks."
0,"Floats like a butterfly, stings like a gnat."
1," When it's being its goofy funny self, it scores."
1, Eventually wins you over with its warmth and offbeat sensibility.
0, Subnormal horror fare...the combination of an unimaginative plot with what's by now a pedestrian technique makes for a pretty barren ninety minutes.
0," A film that, in bare description, sounds like the greatest outrage ever put to screen, but ends up being fairly tedious when watched."
0, It's Freaky Friday with dudes. That does not make it better. 
1, A muddled tale of a corporate high-flying huckster brought low.
1, Here's the animated space adventure I've been hoping for.
0," Too often [Talley] is unwilling to let his fabulous, flamboyant guard down. Disappointing."
0, James Franco's now tiresome androgyny (so soon?) asks for wink-nod approval of Ginsberg's hero status without adequately delineating Ginsberg's personality or the emotional tensions of the late-'50s era.
1," Good Time combines anarchic sensibilities with an exacting style, its loopy plot starting in dark places and heads into willfully absurd directions before doubling back to a wakeup call."
1, Believe the Best Picture Oscar nomination and the universal praise. The Tale of Princess Kaguya is a joy.
0," Unfortunately, it ends up playing like Max Headroom Conquers the Universe."
1," It's clear that veteran director Bertrand Tavernier has set out to show the potency and relevance of a classic love story and that period romance is by no means a dead genre. On this evidence, he has a point."
1, Sharp dialogue and detailed observations make it a good deal funnier than you might expect.
0," The vibrant Los Angeles backdrop and colorful characters make for some great film, but Rules Don't Apply comes with lots of turbulence and a bumpy landing."
1,"This sort of movie ultimately soars or sinks on the strength of its visual effects, and supervisor Richard R. Hoover and his crew don't disappoint."
0," There's a good chance Hancock will still rake in the cash over the next few weeks solely because of Smith's marketability, but as a whole the film is his most deplorable project since 1999's Wild Wild West."
0," An inferior Blumhouse production that has bits and pieces that work, but doesn't ultimately deliver. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," To many she was a saint, but there's only so much adoration one can take before longing for a more down-to-earth perspective."
0, The ensuing cycle of miscommunication is endless and trying.
1, Is the film inspirational? Absolutely. Are its performances worthy? You bet.
0," For a film that purports to go beyond the surface and uncover the ""true essence"" of adult film stars, ""Aroused"" spends a lot of time admiring the surface."
1," Gloriously melodramatic, I Am Love is an opulent delight."
1," Strong performances and vivid production design buoy up this evocative, troubling film that shows flashes of brilliance from writer/director Simon Blake, making his feature debut."
1, Kick-Ass lives up to its name ...
0," An almost unmitigated disaster, this major studio production with a major star in the lead (the Oscar-winning Halle Berry) comes across like a direct-to-video production, complete with ultra lame computer-generated effects and clueless direction ..."
0, You don't have to wait too long in the sci-fi adventure After Earth to get the uneasy feeling that you're going to be in for an awfully long 100 minutes.
0," This is less a film than an argument -- so much so that it's hard to imagine many film critics, or audiences, without some knowledge of economic history being able to respond to it in any way except with sheer terror."
0, Hopelessly dull and astonishingly amateurish...
0, The whole thing ends up feeling like a superficial cross between a starstruck version of Vice's gonzo travelogues and a highly (ahem) stage-managed portrait of an artist in transition.
1," Singer marshals his camera and soundtrack well as his tense, behind-the-scenes chess game plays out..."
1," While it's not particularly emotional and I was disappointed by how many questions are left open by its shallow visits to the real world, it's still a lot of fun. "
1," ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is a smart comedy about people, their foibles and the enduring strength of relationships."
1, A pleasant surprise.
1, It's the kind of high-toned message picture that allows the viewer to feel safely progressive-minded with no personal risk.
0," In the world of this sitcom love story, men are from Mars and women should be from a defiled menstrual tent far enough away that Adam Sandler won't have to hear them talk about tampons."
1, The interviews are as entertaining as the slick interplay on the ice.
0," It's a slick enough movie, with an intriguing enough concept. It would be a much more enjoyable movie, however, if the wheels didn't come off script-wise."
0," The sets are laughably cheap, and the aliens look like geeks from a Star Trek convention who couldn't afford to buy the ""good"" Klingon costumes"
1," Rebecca Hall's performance is incredible. Her Christine is awkward, full of nervous energy, and impossible to look away from. But Campos missed an opportunity to fully explore Christine's mental-health challenges."
0, ...suffers from an uneven sensibility that essentially holds the viewer at arm's length virtually from start to finish.
1, There are times when Margot at the Wedding is almost impossible to watch. And I think writer/director Noah Baumbach wants it that way.
1," Series writer/director James DeMonaco's trilogy capper is the best of the bunch, exploitative drive-in fare sure to incite audiences by capitalizing on the current political zeitgeist."
0,"Filled with gorgeous images, expertly assembled and perfectly set to music. But for the most part, it's all completely superfluous"
1," There's a great sense of invention to the way they've laid out the landscape of the mind here, and there are some sequences that are pure animation in a way that Pixar rarely gets to indulge in their features."
1," The movie's feel for urban warfare takes its cue, though not its severe, disturbing edge, from street-level spectacles like Heat and Ronin. "
1," While the note-perfect script, written by the late Melissa Matheson (who also scripted E.T.), treats Dahl's words with radiant respect, it also subtly reworks them to make the story cinematic to its soul."
0," Yet another big film that looks just the same as a stack of others. Eternally overcast and dimly lit, there are no fresh idea here... Worse still, you can really feel the strain in the storytelling."
1," A hell of a good time for those willing to settle into its easygoing vibe, especially during its climactic, impeccably choreographed showcase, which sent me home with a big, goofy grim plastered on my face."
1,"Well researched, and anchored by Rachel Weisz's impressive lead performance, this is a fascinating film that avoids the Hollywood epic route."
0,Chuck Pfarrer's screenplay feels older than the Martian hills.
1, Erwa's emotional candour ensures his film will strike resonant chords with anybody who spent their formative years extricating themselves from strangulating family ties.
1," Although The Proposal isn't a sweep-you-off-your-feet affair, Bullock and Reynolds make it a thoroughly charming engagement."
0, Director Catherine Hardwicke is out to tap into the demographic of 13 to 18-year-old tweens who fund these gothic soap operas with their babysitting money. 
1," A wrenching picture about South Africa that makes no expedient compromises with feel-good entertainment values, A Dry White Season displays riveting performances and visceral style."
0, A pretty good idea for a sci-fi thriller is undermined by hastiness - and by the pretense that it was mostly shot by one of its protagonists.
1," What keeps Chamber from quite ringing the gong? Probably nothing if you're a diehard fan of the books; but if you're not, you might find the 161-minute running time just a little much."
0," The movie is a pleasant way to spend time in the dark, especially for Francophiles, but it won't leave any lasting impression."
1," Thor is, dare you say, a marvellous adventure, fit for a sequel and deserving his place in Marvel's soon to be mega team-up."
1," Like executing a gravity-defying trick, you can't overthink things ... This film, unfortunately, doesn't land the trick. Nor does it fall too hard, though."
1," The film explores the psychology of female role-play with depth and intelligence, and the performances are outstanding -- Binoche brings her expected ethereal complexity, and Stewart cuts through her aura like vinegar through grease."
1," This slippery, undefined, but gaping loss makes Godard's forceful, elegant, and profound film all the more unshakable."
1, Ponsoldt's film is more interested in what lies beneath the skin of the men than the covers of the book.
1, Cleverly explores the evils of modern privilege... but it could have been scarier.
1," If Huerta was a fringe player in history before, ""Dolores"" rightfully restores the importance of her accomplishments and the urgency of her message."
0," It's got a talented cast that manage to create a few powerful moments, but overall the film feels contrived and hollow. Unlike the book."
1, Alice Creed sucks you in immediately with a beautifully edited opening sequence.
0," [I]t's a very good thing the giants are as effectively villainous as they are; otherwise, the movie, for the most part, would be a predictable, uninspired affair."
0, Misplaced hero-worship and glibness get in the way of its amazing true story.
0," The horrors of sex never make cosy viewing, just as the horrors of sex addiction never make interesting plots."
0, [A] weepy romance that's tedious and long drawn.
0," I guess ""Commonplace Four"" or ""Tedious Four"" didn't have the same ring to it."
1, [Miller is] too interested in who her women are and what they might become to worry about what they should be.
0," Which came first, bullies or dead animals in jars? ""Friend"" does not say, nor is there a clear link between the discord in Jeff's home and his behavior."
1,Low-key charmer saved by star power
0," My advice to these filmmakers otherwise is take your 'national security directive,' shove it into your 'encryption packet' and 'initiate damage control.'"
1," McCain's frank discussions about his limited time left here on Earth and the end of a mission of ""serving something more important than myself"" are profound and moving."
1,A funny and fetching comedy about the resiliency of the human spirit.
1, Recalls the unease that crept over the world's youth back at the turn of the last century.
1," Spoilt, rich, posh, vacuous and fame-obsessed - who better to play Edie Sedgwick? If she's acting or not, Miller is brilliant. Just a shame the film is so shallow too."
0," When it's not fast and furious, ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" settles for slick and noisy... and it's often hard to tell these two moods apart."
0," The most rousing moment in The Magnificent Seven comes after the action has already concluded, when the credits roll to the emphatic accompaniment of Elmer Bernstein's iconic 1960 score."
1, Ms. Stewart [in] the best role of her life
0," An amusing, frustrating and wildly uneven comedy farce that I just can't imagine is going to play well to most anyone but a number of film critics who might admire the pic's derring-do. (Parental Review also Available)"
1, What makes it compelling is Malek's solid performance.
1," A film that deserves attention, if not your full respect."
1, The film's penchant for repetition is faithful to its '50s source material and is the very quality that turns Mars Attacks! into such a marvelously unstable comedy.
0, Relentlessly shrill and awkward.
1," There's behavioral truth here I wish the production trusted more, but the basics of Beyond the Lights are secure, offering those in the mood for tenderness a nice alternative at the multiplex."
1," ""Here's Johnny!"" ... Kubrick's grandiose Jack-in-a-box shocker is a fright, but it's hardly up to his earlier brilliance."
0,"Beautifully made and features a marvelous performance by Donald Sutherland as the track coach Bill Bowerman, but the movie is no more than moderately interesting."
0," Genre homage or not, trashy, assault-coddling sexism is a turn off - and worse."
0,"The film wakes up when the case goes to court, but until then it's a plodding affair and so saccharine that we have to wonder if we're really getting the whole story."
0, The film's observations don't offer much depth or substance; the contemplation of destructive behavior in private mirroring destruction at an international level is sharp but hollow.
1,It feels like the backstory behind half the world's wayward kids.
1," The feel-good documentary of the year, featuring the irresistible 1960s music that made Detroit famous."
1," This is not a kid's cartoon and the terrific 2D drawing coupled with the wonderful, warm and touching adapted story is definitely aimed at film buffs everywhere. But, everyone else should see it, too."
0,"Director Andrew Stanton...admirably decided to keep the material wedded to its time, but he can't get around the fact that his Tharks resemble Jar Jar Binks and the whole enterprise resembles last year's ""Conan the Barbarian"" remake."
1,"There has never been a better time for a woman-centric movie, especially one about a smart, angry woman."
1," While I'm not sure this is worthy of checking out on the big screen, it's certainly fun to sit down with an audience looking for dumb delights."
1,"The Road Warrior with plummier accents, Reign of Fire is fun because the dragons are fun."
0, Intricate visual world eventually falls prey to the truth of a cliché: Familiarity breeds contempt 
1, Chemistry is everything. Garner and Affleck don't have it with each other and Daredevil never quite has it with the audience.
0," An utterly gorgeous visual delight, and it has some enjoyably goofy moments, managing to throw in some left-leaning, anti-elitism socio-economic subtext for good measure. "
0," If anything the film suffers, appropriately if unfortunately enough, from being too eager to please."
1," The bleak chic of this SF drama is intriguing, but the script that starts out smart and elegant soon slips into the shoddy and familiar."
0," The hero is named for a disgusting bodily function that's hardly PG material, but the movie itself seems to be aimed at grade schoolers."
1, It can fairly be described as little more than a B-movie in a ballgown. But it must be said: It's a pretty fetching ballgown.
0," What's the bright side to ""The Upside?"" You'll likely be watching this for free on TBS within 6 months as cannon fodder for a lineup of other oft-forgettable, saccharine affairs."
0," August: Osage County, however, bitterly funny in some places and numbingly earnest in others, is just too much Streep."
1," [As a] horror fan who tolerated and then promptly forgot all about Ouija '14, I found myself more than reasonably engaged by what Flanagan and company cooked up for this offbeat, soft-spoken, and subtly spooky prequel."
0,Darling Companion is nothing more than another story about a trip into the glories of nature that is ruined by a swarm of annoying WASPs.
0, Compliance is diminutively sufficient and blandly adequate with no additional layers that elevate its small independent nature. It feels rather one note riding on the promise of a distinctive tale that never totally comes to fulfillment.
0," 80 some odd minutes of bland, boring, tedious nonsense. Utterly inept and squandering potential at every opportunity, the only 'interesting' thing the film has going for it is an ending that is totally bizarro, terribly conceived and bafflingly stupid. "
1, Spielberg was able to make a post-9/11 film about a foreigner in an American airport without getting on a soap box about terrorism or airport anxiety
1," ""Novitiate"" shows the Church that I grew up with all its rituals and rules and the radical changes that were made with Vatican II."
0, Back-Up Needs a Better Plan.
1," You're Next shakes up the genre after a raft of recent contenders, such as the slicker-looking (but less effective) The Purge."
0," The movie is unprepared for the crime-flick beats it tries to hit, and if Jonny's plan is a head-scratcher, the multiple twists that follow are even tougher to accept."
0," For those of us who enjoy good movies and plausible plot lines, wait to see it on cable or rent it cheap. Or, just avoid it."
1," Everywhere you look, there's something delightfully weird going on ... Altman and company fashion a state of slouching, freeform Zen that no one else has ever really duplicated."
0," Venom may not be a great superhero movie, but it's definitely going to make you laugh."
0, It's clear that the novelty of Hell Fest's very existence (ie a 1980s-style slasher) carries it for almost the entirety of its appreciatively brief running time...
0,The movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts.
0," As always, the biggest screams emanating from the audience come when Lautner bares his chest."
0, Anderson's signature style is feeling the pressure of the law of diminishing returns -- a law as menacing to the artist as that of gravity is to the balloonist.
0, The film does not exactly make a convincing case for the idea of Berlin as a hub of passion.
1," Riveting to watch largely due to Asia Argento's presence, Assayas' new film, suitably placed at the Midnight Section, displays visual fluency and other innovative devices deiberately applied to a lower-level subject that some will dismiss as trash."
1," It's a somewhat blunt and righteously angry admonishment of the Greek state, but its shocking exploration of economic debasement helps retain the momentum right up to it's shocking double denouement."
0," An unfunny, unsuccessful, elitist spoof about what happens when art and commerce collide."
0," There's considerable gap between the film's ambition, which is to be a high-minded literary feature a la Atonement or The Hours, and its actual level of execution."
0," Harkema's real problem is that he doesn't know which story he wants to tell, apart from taking potshots at governments, religions and ideologies he opposes."
0, Brave is stock Disney storytelling dressed up with Pixar majesty.
0, It's not egregiously awful like the first film. Just plain awful in that formula way that kills your spirit and all hope for summer movies.
0, Writer Chad St. John and director Jeffrey Nachmanoff never figured out what story they were trying to tell.
1," The poignancy of Fonda's point of view on the various topics adds tremendously to the unfolding of this excellent film. Fonda makes no excuses saying, ""I am what I am."""
0," It is proof positive that this emperor of comedy has no clothes, a fact that he seems depressingly eager to demonstrate throughout."
1, An ode to the making of movies and the sacred art of turning dreams into reality.
1," The pencil and crayon drawings come to vivid, colorful life to tell a more complex (if hardly subtle) story than you would expect."
0, ... mainstream moviemaking with indie colors and oddball edges just quirky enough not to offend.
0, ...pointless piffle...the dreamy diatribe of First Daughter is nothing but puffy political pap that needs to be left alone in an unattended ballot box
1," [Deadpool] is filthy, degenerate and seriously pervy, and Reynolds -- decked out in red and black spandex, sporting two katanas and white canvas where eyes should be -- is every bit as flip, funny, nasty and self-deprecating as you'd want."
1," We just don't see this kind of thing here in America, but there's also never been a couple in the White House like Barack and Michelle Obama."
1," Warren Beatty's comeback movie is a sometimes bizarre, sometimes winning film about multi-hyphenate billionaire Howard Hughes (Beatty) in 1959 and 1964..."
0, The biting revelation promised by the title of Robert Luketic's fluff never bares its teeth.
0, Ma Ma suffers from melodrama without catharsis. 
1, Actually really mostly pretty good.
0, To take Showgirls that seriously (as either trash-art or appalling pornography) wouldn't be worth the exertion.
0, Panders to the base seekers of cheap thrills.
0," Capably shot, well acted (notwithstanding Kate Winslet's shape-shifting accent), its score propulsive, if a little too insistent, it's a finely crafted piece of work. But as a film, I found it nearly insufferable."
0," Like a compost of Rocky Horror and Sweeney Todd, but without the floridity or the savage wit."
0," Tries so hard to be an instant cult classic, but it doesn't quite make the cut."
1," Sadomasochism is treated as a joke in Secretary, but the fun of the movie is that it's also much more than a joke."
0," In the feature-length soap opera ""Mother and Child,"" writer-director Rodrigo Garcia creates a multiple narrative about women, the choices - sometimes forced upon them - that they make regarding childbirth and the manifold repercussions."
0, Joins the Porky's triptych as teensploitation smut franchises that have made it to three installments.
1, Still a great entertainment and a welcome addition to any Disney library.
1, Bridget feels refreshingly real.
1," A slightly more adventurous story breaks the trequel curse: this film is actually better than its predecessors. In addition to astoundingly eye-catching animation, this one also has a driving (albeit corny) narrative and some snappy new characters."
0," Wild chronicles the completion of a daunting physical challenge while intimating that it's about something more spiritual, more meaningful. It isn't."
1, Beauty & The Beast is an efficient crowd-pleaser that makes it easy enough to overlook its flaws (especially if you're part of its target audience).
0," Cowboys & Aliens is no less than the first colossal, epic turd of the Summer of 2011."
0," It is in essence a feature-length version of an inspiring social media image macro, or perhaps a Google Doodle. "
0," Arnold Schwarzenegger provides a jolt of energy to the final half-hour of this otherwise lackluster satire about bickering hitmen, as he sends up his image and action tropes in general with freewheeling bravado."
0," By the closing credits you too will share the characters' grief, solemnly mourning 137 minutes you'll never get back. Insufferable."
1," Through interviews with family, friends and colleagues, it provides an entertaining, telling look at both the man and his beliefs."
1, The pic is watchable because its star Carey Mulligan gives an affecting performance.
1," Often confronts a far-from-light subject, but its glamorous characters and occasional levity are fun."
0,It's hard to escape the conclusion that all the originality and excitement have been drained from the series.
0," Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a sloppy, unholy mess. It is a blight, not only upon the art of cinema, but upon humanity itself."
1, Another dazzling film by Sweden's Ruben Östlund.
0," Not content to go for cheap laughs, the movie ultimately tries to wave a banner for the slacker ethos, something about the value of free expression."
0," Disappointing thriller that's let down by a tedious script, a frankly ridiculous final act and some dodgy overacting by Kevin Spacey."
0," [An] innocuous, blandly therapeutic remake of a comedy that wasn't exactly edgy to begin with."
0, An above-average heist thriller that's undone by poor screenwriting and worse post-production. 
1," It's solid filmmaking that, bafflingly, leaves little to talk about on the way home."
1, Isao Takahata's powerful anti-war movie is all the more harrowing for the care we invest in its beautifully drawn children.
0," Allen has created movie magic on many occasions, but in this instance, the man behind the curtain has gone noticeably MIA."
0,"Mr. Palminteri's primary duties include glowering at henchmen Bruno and Roscoe, saying 'get me that diamond' a few times and, ultimately, taking a toy airplane to the crotch."
0,A cloistered romantic story more typical of a Nicholas Sparks's work translation than a passionate drama. [Full review in Spanish]
0," The script by Paul Guyot and first-time director Dean Devlin putters around with leftover parts from disaster movies that were badly written in the first place, stranding a decent cast."
0," His wife doesn't love him, his son's scared by him and he seems to be on better social terms with his enemies than his friends. Then again, we can't quite blame them. We don't like the guy either."
1," The filmmakers, Scott McGehee and David Siegel, seem not at all intimidated by Henry James's formidable prose."
1," The movie weaves flawless performances by Bonnie Hunt, Chris Sarandon, Michael Learned and others into a mesmerizing tapestry of familial yearning and loss."
1, [Marlene Dietrich] was never better than she is here.
0," There's just no economy of words or plotting or pacing here, and that's a shame. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)"
1," Powerful, edgy, but overlong film about search for identity."
0," An unremarkable, standard-issue shoot-em-up that rests entirely on the charisma of its two stars."
1," What makes the movie work is so simple and economical-you snooze, you die. I've always admired its simplicity."
0," For a film so boastful about preserving history, it seems all too content to commercialise its own story."
1, One of the great international hits of classic French cinema.
0, Mother and Child winds up with some very mixed messages.
1," Overall, X-Men: Days of Future Past is slick fun, in the tradition of slick, fun summer movies. Just don't start thinking about the plot, because it won't hold together."
1," 'A Wrinkle in Time' delivers timeless messages about love, friendship."
0," Before I Disappear is ultimately hampered not by a messy plot but by bland characters who, for the most part, don't so much talk to each other as they monologue at each other."
1," ... A shrewd piece of classical, big-screen entertainment. "
1," The immediate thrill of Climax, [Gaspar] Noe's newest and unquestionably best film, is how, for the first time, you see him letting go a little bit, releasing some of his notorious control, letting his films and his characters breathe a little bit."
0," Despite all the sturm-und-drang of Alma Mahler's life, Bride Of The Wind fails to arouse much emotion in the viewer."
0," Its pretentiousness, incoherent story, and huge logic holes make a disjointed mess."
0," By the time it starts getting dramatic, I was rooting for each one of them to get a divorce."
0," Writer-director David Twohy has a much bigger budget than he did for Pitch Black, but he makes the all-too-common mistake of believing money can substitute for imagination."
0," The movie is almost completely lacking in suspense, surprise and consistent emotional conviction."
0, There is truly never a dull moment but that's not the same thing as good ones.
0," Return to Sender is an equally repulsive and dreadful movie that deserves to be more than spoiled -- it should be murdered, buried, and never discussed again."
1, The film sets a brilliant standard for feature-length animation.
1, The difference between Apatow and Hornby is that Hornby has written at least one compelling female character.
0," Tries way too hard to recapture the magic of the first movie ... lacks the emotional impact, replacing it with more common horror movie cliches."
0, The characters are so deliciously absurd.
0, The Mountain is for the most determinedly miserabilist only.
1," The film is stylistic dynamite, and the clear ad-libbing throughout only heightens the atmosphere."
0," This film retains many of the qualities of theater. But without the benefit of theatrical devices that might clarify the order of events, its time warps undermine the plot."
0, Drug use and cliches mar unoriginal indie dramedy.
0," They wanted to make a To Kill a Mockingbird. Instead they made, To Kill an Annoying Parrot."
0, I'm not sure I've ever seen a fantasy film that's at once so visually amazing and so emotionally dead.
1," This is not high art cinema, but for ninety minutes Mr. Right is just plain fun."
0, ...yet another in a long line of disappointments from a once rock-solid filmmaker.
1," As a colourful, smoothly edited nostalgia trip, it's fine; perhaps there'll be more depth in the planned television series."
0," The Hughes Brothers may want us to think they're giving us a few deep, quasi-spiritual ideas, but what they're really serving up is earnestly shallow, machete-and-bow-and-arrow entertainment."
1," 110 minutes or so in the middle of this 141-minute hero sandwich ... are a guily, guilty, guilty-your-honor pleasure."
0," Made in the crappy Murray years between CADDYSHACK and RUSHMORE. A few laughs, but mostly forgettable."
1, The raptures that greeted Ramin Bahrani's Goodbye Solo at festivals last year are wholly deserved.
1," There's little new here, but uniformly powerful performances (especially Owen's) give the tale unexpected power and depth."
0," Borrowing from all manner of similar films and television shows, Acts Of Vengeance fails to blend these elements into a cohesive narrative."
0, It's sad to see what started out as such a lively and creative series descend to this -- a feeble attempt to stretch a few pedestrian jokes into a feature-length film.
1, An instant classic ready for enduring cult success.
0," Despite some amusing moments, everyone simply works too hard at providing rambunctious zaniness, until one grows painfully aware the inevitable outtakes reel will be superior to the movie."
1,"There are many themes running through The Tin Drum: resistance against an unkind world, the need for acceptance, the horrors of romance and war, and the final idea that growth is inevitable and unfortunately, necessary."
0," Miss Bala is wretched, directed by Catherine Hardwicke like a late-'90s music video and written by Gareth Dunnett-Alcocer as a shoddy soap opera. "
0,The film has about five too many poop jokes.
0," A disappointing marriage of science fiction and action, with too much sci-fi nonsense and not nearly enough action."
0," Sadly, it's yet another disingenuous, botched adaptation that wants to make money off of the fan base, while conveying obvious embarrassment toward the property."
0," The latest R-rated comedy from director Kevin Smith (Clerks) is immature and sloppy. Fortunately, the movie is also pretty darn funny."
1, The new Vacation is both better than I'd feared and not as hilarious as I'd hoped. It's intermittently funny and instantly forgettable.
1," Lively and personal but never quite breaking the surface, this documentary about the boy band phenomenon traces both their 20-year anniversary project..."
1, The Coen Brothers hit the bull's-eye with this captivating western where the good guys fight with words first and guns second.
1," Annie Hall is refreshing because it showed an astonishing leap in creativity, exploration, and cinematic curiosity from Allen's previous film."
1," Two compelling leads and a mix of adventure and romance. It's a pleasant experience, if not one that will linger long in the memory."
0," This has its visually wondrous moments, and the lead (Lewis MacDougall) is a true find, but there's too much bark, too little bite."
0," Over-used clichés like a slow-motion funeral procession in the snow and over-used dialogue like ""You got no idea what it takes to do what we do."" Now that's a crime."
1," This new menu movie has a soapy plot, appealing stars, family values, down-home atmosphere and a conviction that there's rarely a problem fried chicken can't cure. There sure are worse ways of looking at the world than that."
1," Everything the perfect ""family horror"" movie should be."
0,It is always maddening watching musical 'geniuses' in the cinema when their visibly incompetent efforts bear no relation to what you hear.
0," What starts out as a decent thriller soon winds up plummeting to the ground, brought down by its own improbable plot twists and illogical storyline."
1," While it's quite possible for the cinematically unaware to enjoy this film, this is a real treat for movie buffs. The story is as much about the love of motion pictures as it is about gangsters."
0, A shockingly horrendous film that strips away every bit of Michel Gondry's gifted imagination. 
1," The Way Back isn't much of a Christmas film, but it makes you glad to be indoors."
0," Doesn't have much to say about marriage other than that it's complex, and often fraught with disappointment, deception and conflicting urges."
0," As much as I can recognize the obvious effort and specific intent that went into the film, I am at a complete loss to comprehend what exactly it's trying to say to me."
1," Guggenhiem has captured a beautiful, truthful portrait of an incredibly brave girl. "
1," As a whole, I cannot recommend Wolfman's Got Nards enough for those who love The Monster Squad, for fans of the horror genre, or even for anyone who has ever felt misunderstood by the world at large. "
1, A beautiful little paean to the trivialities and triumphs of everyday life.
1," Sparkling with wit, sensitive to situational humour and filled with catchy, quirky dialogues."
0, Wraps so much kids' mythology into one holiday package that it can't avoid tangling the ribbons.
1," Pratfalls aside, Barbershop gets its greatest play from the timeless spectacle of people really talking to each other."
0," For all but the most forgiving horror fans, this is a lazy, stupid and incoherent failure."
1," Weekend is finally a deeply romantic film, assured of the pleasure that one person can find in another, but rooted in the quirks and textures of contemporary British life."
1," 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 days feels like a kind of appendix -- and a bursting one at that -- to Krzysztof Kieslowski's Decalogue."
0," Although it contains a smattering of guilty pleasure moments, few are likely to admit that as the film is far guiltier of being bad rather than pleasurable."
0," As with most sugary indulgences, G.I. Joe's sweet, dizzying high is followed almost immediately by a painful crash."
0," The Devil may have all the best tunes, but this exorcism thriller won't count as one of his greatest gigs."
1, Shutter Island with eels. Gore Verbinski has delivered one of the strangest mainstream studio films in recent memory.
1," Understated, well-acted and likely never to be heard from again, Girlfriend is the kind of movie you come to film festivals to see."
0," Part III was an improvement on Part II, mainly because it wasn't a carbon copy of the original, but it's still pretty well a dud."
1," This may be a thriller starring Jake Gyllenhaal, but mainstream audiences should also note that this is an artful film that refuses to tell its story using the usual formula."
1," ""Democrats"" is a captivating documentary chronicling the corrupt political environment in Zimbabwe as its current leader, President Robert Mugabe, attempts to cede control and open up the country to draft a new constitution."
1, Comically dexterous!
1," Tron Legacy is one of the most visually stunning pieces of entertainment ever made. Dear the Academy Awards, please nominate Daft Punk for best original score!"
0," The film rarely maintains an image for more than a few seconds. Everything must be rapid, colorful and artsy, but it is an intellectual sham."
1," Stillman cannot only still bring it verbose-style, but he can make it fun, cheerful and even optimistic in the process."
1," Writer-director Harmony Korine shows progress as a craftsman with this tale, which is at once his most accessible feature as well as deconstructive critique of a popular American subgenre."
1,"Carol is a complex human story about unspoken desire, social expectations and an authentic life."
0," The story of a bereaved man who starts to dismantle household appliances and, later, buildings, the whole movie is a laboured metaphor: we get it, he's falling apart."
0," One by one, each of them acknowledges his or her problem, they talk it out, and by the end of the week everybody's OK."
0," Barrymore is actually becoming quite the deft physical comedienne, unafraid to make herself look unsightly for effect. But her performance isn't enough to overcome even one of the other problems."
0," We've revisited a franchise that failed to get off the ground with its preceding, 2007 endeavour - and one that could struggle to do so yet again."
1," The kind of serious, A-quality horror studios shy away from. A throwback to movies like THE EXORCIST and THE SHINNING. "
0," [Jim Norton] manages to elevate the script and role he was given and bring comedic life to his character. Unfortunately, the good doesn't help the story's blandness. "
0," A patchy, intermittently captivating hodgepodge that begins promisingly before losing its narrative thread..."
1, It is an effective - and affecting - immersive experience for those who wish to understand exactly what drives people like Elon Musk.
0," Kevin Smith turns out to be reverent after all: he wants to separate true love from mere copulating for money, but his story mixes romance and porn so inextricably that he seems confused, and the movie trips over its own conceits."
0," The characterizations are wooden, the interaction maudlin and the plot totally predictable."
0," Each of the threads works on its own, but the combination becomes problematic."
1," Credit Invincible with varying the Disney formula just a bit. While still a ""feel good"" movie, it's a dark and miserable road that must be traveled along the way."
0," It's a beautiful picture to look at, as all of his films are, but good use of color and mixing up your film stock do not a classic make."
0," With these evildoers exuding such charisma, it's no wonder that the film's message about the immorality of gun-running gets diluted."
1, The Spectacular Now reminds us that even the most familiar set ups and stories can feel refreshing and energized by superb execution.
1," When describing Kenneth Branagh's take on Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express, [old fashioned] should definitely be taken as a compliment."
1," A delicately balanced film, driven by...glorious actors and a gorgeous soundtrack."
0, A real Christmas miracle would cause every copy of this film to spontaneously burst into flames.
0," nothing more than a time suck, a way of wasting a few hours away from home"
1, ... a superb and entertaining thriller.
0," Bohemian Rhapsody is bad in the way a lot of biopics are bad: it's superficial, it avoids complexity, and the narrative has a connect-the-dots quality."
0, The Notorious Bettie Page is a perfect example of a film that has a subject but no story.
0," What a strange, disjointed movie. Ultimately the tone is just all over the place, and there are just about no stakes."
0," Sweet and funny, this is more suitable for a TV movie than a big screen feature"
1,It's like a screwball comedy written by the existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre.
1," The Favourite is a brilliant dark comedy, shattering notions of aristocratic decency with glee."
1," A hell of a good time for those willing to settle into its easygoing vibe, especially during its climactic, impeccably choreographed showcase, which sent me home with a big, goofy grim plastered on my face."
1," The most interesting role, of course, is Ava, and Vikander nails it. It's actually possible to say of this film that it's worth seeing just for the robot."
1," Three hours, ten minutes is a long time to keep an audience involved in 10 characters..."
1,It may be Loach's saddest film.
0, Ciarán Foy provides a further link to the first film by resolutely failing to generate any decent scares.
0, I don't think I've witnessed a film this year that managed to so completely and utterly collapse into crass garbage in its last few minutes while abusing what little goodwill it has.
1, A joyous production which emotional side is reinforced by Meryl Streep's performance. [Full review in Spanish]
1,"Beautifully constructed, unexpectedly touching, and gorgeous to behold, it's a swirling kaleidoscope of murder, intrigue, and musical numbers that cinematic bon vivants will eagerly devour."
1," While the hard-to-navigate hell that is a courtroom is familiar genre territory, few works of legal fiction feel this deliciously droll. Court's cynical, but absolutely never sorry."
0," One could make a great movie out of this set-up, though sadly ""We're the Millers"" doesn't."
0, Isn't quite up to the task of intelligently advocating for change.
1," First Man's privileging of the forbidding reality of the space program points to a kind of anti-triumphant masochism, a belief that the destination is less important than the grueling misery of the journey."
1," Offers audiences movie pleasures, as well as emotionally authentic challenges."
0, This can't be the kind of equality that those Stonewall activists were fighting for: the right to have their story turned into formulaic historical fiction as tedious as the kind about straight people.
0, a gale force of energy and creativity in the service of a lame idea
1," While Hitchcock's masterpiece is unquestionably the more mainstream and formally groundbreaking of the two films, it's arguable that Peeping Tom is the more thematically profound and insightful work. Just don't expect to feel good after watching it."
0," What's left, once one accounts for the suffocating and stultifying plot mechanics? Polished cutesiness; attractive shots of beach sides; and a good, mostly underutilized ensemble cast."
0," For the audience, it's a weekend they'll wish to forget."
1," This was standout TV for which Tuza-Ritter will doubtless, and rightly, win awards."
0, Something the movie fails to consider: that it's possible to have a low opinion of both the Iraq war and Mains' actions in London.
1," Super 8 is a tremendously entertaining summer movie that could pass as a lost Steven Spielberg work from, say, 1979, which, not coincidentally, is the story's setting."
1," Nichols ... tells the Lovings' story in a way that feels immediate and modern, and not just like a history lesson."
0," Ignorance may be bliss, but encouraging it, as Expelled does, ought to be a crime."
1, So beautifully made that it comes close to perfect.
1," Corpse Bride is such a treat for the eyes, ears and funny bone that you feel cheated that it clocks in at less than an hour-and-a-quarter."
1," When cinema reflects current conflicts, a certain aesthetic typically develops, and ""Good Kill,"" Andrew Niccol's drone strike-era drama, makes a convincing case for the next phase of that evolution."
0, It doesn't offer viewers anything more than the sight of a talented director treading water with a story he seems to have little interest in telling.
0," Too many sequences feel generic, from the unexamined privilege that serves as the movie's cultural backdrop to the now-requisite scene of a man changing a diaper while covered in baby poop."
0," While the joke wears thin very quickly, there are a number of amusing sequences, which are combined with some exciting road action to provide a mildly entertaining - and totally mindless - film."
0, The implicit castigation the documentary has to offer is hard to miss. So is the sense of overriding fascination. Is it possible to cast a cold eye if the look being given is so wide-eyed?
1," This is survival, revealed in all the blunt details of a documentary portrait and the simple power of [Michelle] Williams' unadorned, Oscar-worthy performance."
1," There are few conventional thrills on offer here, but plenty of humour and charm."
1, A solid entry in the modern world of computer-generated animations and a promising start for debut director Jennifer Yuh Nelson.
1,"A suggestive, subjective account of an orphan boy's apprenticeship to a dashing smuggler."
0, Brit wit writ by Yank wank stank.
1," The movie is more a situation than a narrative, and it's repetitive and depressing."
0," The movie's heart is in the right place, but all its messages of tolerance might resonate better if the Spanish-accented pirate didn't get drawn with a gold tooth and the turban-wearing Khalil wasn't an opportunistic rug merchant."
0," It's errant camp, which has the effect of undermining our involvement in the mystery."
0," The laughs are few and far between and the movie never succeeds in developing any sort of dramatic tension. I expected better from Sandler, even though I've seen far worse from him."
1," Four Weddings and a Funeral is one of those rare films that have you smiling from the get-go, and keep you that way -- with a few well-earned poignant interludes (including, of all things, a reading of W.H. Auden) -- right to the end."
0, On the plus side there's no putting up with Brown's infernal prose.
0, Director Patrick Creadon collects rich material but builds a rickety structure.
0," Far too often, watching The Corporation is like watching someone deliver a lengthy book report, with constant repetition of themes and an unfortunate tendency to state the obvious."
0, You get the feeling there must be a far better version of it on the floor of some editing room in L.A.
0," Green Book (fancies) itself a progressive .... awards season film, but there are moments in the narrative which are unbelievably tone deaf and in truth, almost regressive. "
0, A bit of a letdown.
1,"A film that reminds us that old people were once young, and that their youthful passions and dreams are still at play behind the wrinkles."
1," What is oddly alluring about Rushmore, despite its sexual overtones and a couple of creepy plot turns, is its sense of naivete."
0, It's like Sharknado if it had been directed by Al Gore.
0, It is on stage that the troupe really shines ... giving a tantalising hint at what the film could have been had Amalric proved himself as good a filmmaker as he is an actor.
0," To say Fifty Shades Darker is a disappointment is not only an understatement but a ridiculous one. Let's be clear, it was never going to be good."
1, Carnal pleasures and temptations are integral to this intriguing psychological drama in which intricately bound relationships reveal darker undertones beneath the frivolity
0, It lacks the genuinely creepy edge of the original.
0," My greatest fear is watching a film that's so bad that it literally sucks the life right out of you, and I think this one came pretty close."
1,"The movie is basically a sweet confection that, like this year's ""Ready Player One,"" relies heavily on nostalgia and pop-culture references to propel it."
1, The director's occasional artsy flourishes in Godzilla turn an orgiastic display of mass destruction into wily-smart entertainment. 
1," It's the exploration of their human frailty and their brokenness, and the step-by-step examination of the events that would lead to this barbarity, that give Blue Caprice its intensity."
0, 'The Imitation Game' doesn't embarrass itself by trying to explain convoluted mathematical issues; there's nothing on the order of 'A Beautiful Mind''s forehead-slapping breakdown of game theory.
1," Slow and meditative, Cielo offers vertiginous time-lapse photography of the rotating Milky Way, as well as special-effects sequences that recreate astronomical events."
1," It's constantly, engrossingly active, spinning and sparking and exploding in cycles like a Fourth of July catherine wheel."
1,A balanced and devastatingly accurate look at the Bosnian conflict
1," Eschews camp and lends Superman a genuinely fantastic, spiritual heft, one that grounds the ruthless destruction to come and elevates it above mere popcorn spectacle."
1, For all the first-film jitters ... Sleepwalk with Me is a canny and heartwarming comedy that rarely sells the audience short.
1,"Dench gives a superb performance as a simple, trusting woman of faith."
0,"Bride Of Chucky, the fourth film in the Child's Play series, plays like an unfunny and corny parody of the first three films."
1," Bowie keeps the movie out of the doldrums of being just a home video, and it's a sight that deserves viewing for fans of rock and roll."
1,One of the great screen romances.
0," ""'Transcendence' winds up being in the position of being the first - but certainly not the last - big disappointment of the 2014 Summer Movie Season."""
1," Like his former screenplays, Sheridan punctuates his latest endeavour with instances of shocking violence that truly resonate and - one rather ludicrous Mexican standoff aside - they are breathtakingly ferocious."
0, Hess colors the film with his askew sensibility that twists the slapstick into an oddball realm of droll humor that favors the eccentric over the hilarious.
0, Your enjoyment of all this will probably depend heavily on your willingness to let the words romp and Taliban coexist for approximately two hours.
1," Dunagan and McRobbie have a blast in their respective roles, alternating between everyday grandparent oddities and behavior that wouldn't be out of place at the Overlook Hotel. And overall, the young duo makes an affable pair of narrators."
0, It's more of a curiosity than an actual film and barely even works as that. For hardcore Lynch or Herzog fans only and even they should be prepared for something of a disappointment.
1,"I never watched an episode of Veronica Mars when it was on TV, but you don't need to be a die hard fan to like the film. "
0," In its swingiest of hits and misses, Rough Night displays a fantastic same-sex relationship in the same breath as it makes fun of fat people."
0," By the end of this 132-minute journey, I had grown somewhat weary of the tug of war between the two leads, despite disarming efforts from Hammer and Chalamet."
1,"When it gets around to the righteous fightin' and killin' bits, The Expendables more than delivers on its promise to be the manliest movie ever made."
0," Director Todd Kalin seemed the perfect person to bring the Baekeland saga to the screen, and Julianne Moore the perfect person to play the demented and doomed Barbara. So what went wrong?"
0," 'The Ambassador"" is a sociopolitical prankumentary in which the prank blows up in the filmmaker's face, exploding-cigar style."
0," ...while Egoyan's given his titular character her own band and interesting clothes, he's given Seyfried absolutely nothing to build a character from. She's a blank psycho and Egoyan's film is late night Cinemax fare given a high gloss."
0," Barthes feels the need to improve on Flaubert, adding and dropping scenes and inventing social metaphors - mainly spiderwebs and corsets."
1, Electro is like the Rupert Pupkin of supervillains.
0," Has its charms, but never quite gels"
1, Much better than a film about a haunted mirror has any right to be. 
1," Like many compulsively watchable films, the wealth of details in the writing, direction, and characterization all but ensure that Edge of Tomorrow holds many treasures to be discovered on repeat viewings."
0," We're shown so many symptoms that, regardless of which actor is playing the hero, there's little relief from the prevailing grimness, and less sense of a life in full."
0," You'll either think that Zhang's new sumptuous, digitally Botoxed roustabout is simply doing what Hong Kong movies have been too fast, cheap, and out of control to do before or that it's commodifying the tropes into a streamlined McSpectacle."
0, What the film doesn't have is the visceral impact that would take it from a well intentioned treatise to a searing work of art.
0, ...a seriously misguided action epic.
1," Much like screenwriter Roth's Munich, takes a complex set of issues and provides an angled illumination that doesn't easily let the viewer off the hook."
1," Its pleasures are familiar and its frightening bits less frightening than before, but it still does right by a series that's served as proof that, in horror, less can be more. "
0, It doesn't attend to its greatest asset -- the complications of this huge and ferocious character [Alonzo].
1," An entertaining film about sobering true events, this is the story of notorious screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, who defied McCarthy's communist witch-hunt hearings in the late-1940s and was blacklisted by Hollywood for more than a decade. "
1,"An Unexpected Journey is a competent, entertaining effort but it neither enthralls nor amazes in the way its predecessors did."
0, Gong Show impresario Chuck Barris would've gonged it out after ten minutes.
1, What saves the film-and grandly-is Nance's wildly ambitious visual imagination.
0," A lewd spoof of westerns and racial prejudice; enough laughs to cover the fact that it is, essentially, a stupid movie."
1," How patient you'll be depends a lot on how you feel about Ben Stiller, the reigning icon of squirm-inducing weaselly boorishness. What can I say? I love the guy."
1," Unique, gorgeous and hilarious."
0, Predators needed more predators.
0," The film starts to drift and deteriorate into something perilously close to a trite, TV-movie tearjerker rather than something as harrowing and real as a Cassavetes drama."
1," Beautifully shot -- the girls' constantly-changing hair colors are often a focal point -- All This Panic is a quiet, often-heartbreaking reminder of what it's like to be a teenage girl."
1, What carries the movie is Mr. Cruise's impeccable marathon-man star turn.
0," Una comedia previsible, inofensiva y finalmente olvidable sobre el mundo del trabajo, la moda y la frivolidad. Meryl Streep es su principal atractivo."
1, Polanski has found the perfect material with which to address his own World War II experience in his signature style.
0," It's time to abandon the nihilistic characters, the bad jokes, the oppressive set pieces, and start anew. The best thing you can do with Transformers: The Last Knight is leave it behind as quickly as possible."
1," The In-Laws may not be art, and there are some fans of the original who will find it difficult to warm to, but director Andrew Fleming has done a solid job updating it for the 2000s."
0," There's music and dance galore, but the Argentinian cognoscenti will best appreciate this doc, while others may be less diverted."
1," Harold Torres and Carlos Bardem support the entire movie and kept intriguing, though, as the end approaches, the argument loses strictness and neglects his characters in order to offer the twists and suspense a thriller promises. [Full review in Spanish]"
1," Baker places no dramatic emphasis on any individual scene, granting a sense of wide-eyed wonder to major and minor events alike."
0," The creatures remain beautifully designed and Narnia still looks like a colorful, inviting place, but it feels as lifeless as the fantastical anyworlds found on glittery unicorn posters."
0, The most unnecessary sequel since COCOON:THE RETURN. 
1," Cleverly peppered with laughs in its examination of the modern ""untraditional"" family."
1," It's got its flaws, but if you pay close attention, Time Share is an entertaining squirm-fest."
1, A truly mystifying human puzzle.
1, Beautiful to look at and strangely haunting.
1," El Royale may try your patience, though I loved the slow-burn, multi-faceted lead-up to its violent finale... Goddard is an old hand at juggling tropes and character, action and feeling."
0, Robin Hood is beyond saving. Not because it reeks of cynicism - it does - but because it felt that it could get away with this; and that is unforgivable. 
1," Bichevin is the anchor for all of the director's flights of invention. When his Chagall says that life can be wondrous no matter how dire things get, you believe him."
0," At first pass it works but upon revisiting it, it just doesn't hold up."
0," At its prettiest and most self-indulgent, it plays like a cinematographer's reel with a massacre at the end."
0," We expected great things, but the truth is that Mortal Engines leaves much to be desired. [Full review in Spanish]"
1, Even a weak Woody Allen script is better than so many other less witty projects. 'To Rome With Love' is proof of that.
1," With great performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Ben Kingsley, this superhero adventure is a blast and a thrilling kick off to the summer of 2013."
0, Cotillard's impersonation of Piaf at different ages is periodically moving but as a whole the performance is no great success. You can't connect the dots between these women. This teenager is this young star is this old woman?
1, 'Quantum of Solace' has all the bone-breaking stunt work of its predecessor but lacks some of the brain and the heart that made 'Casino Royale' work so well.
1," Movie about college admissions mixes heart, tough issues."
1," The Rock's born again bad guy with a good heart propels this meaty plot to the edge and back as a formidable screen presence. And one who can impressively multitask terror and tenderness in smooth succession, who knew."
1, Remember newspaper movies? Here's a great one.
1,"The movie has been attacked as pro-drug and defended as anti-drug, but actually it is simply pragmatic. It knows that addiction leads to an unmanageable, exhausting, intensely uncomfortable daily routine, and it knows that only two things make it bearable"
0," Another soundtrack-driven, disposable, not entirely objectionable teen movie."
0," But once the two of them fall to fisticuffs, the movie has revealed itself as a lumpy and generic business."
0,"For all its avowed interest in life -- as in, you know, the biological imperatives of our existence -- its characters seem acquainted only with television."
0," Goodwin radiates probity and makes waiting almost look interesting, and so, for all the movie's awkwardness, it remains watchable. But she's waiting for something that's not worth waiting for, not for her and not for us."
1,"The board is set, the pieces are moving and we're set up nicely for Jackson to tighten the noose with the love of second-act grit he displayed in The Two Towers."
1, A classic example of how much an audience can forgive if there's a great opening and terrific ending.
1," As a surprisingly engaging romantic comedy starring an unlikely romantic lead, Dan in Real Life warms your heart in all the right places. And makes you want to eat pancakes."
1, This is a successful film thanks to Wan's unique vision and characters you can care about. Easily one of the best horror films I've seen in quite a while.
1," More than just a film about a woman and her dog, this is about dealing with loss and an exploration of how our own identity is forged by the absence of others. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," I got tired of this joke before the movie ended, but I appreciate the gusto with which the filmmakers -- particularly Coffin, with his nimble vocalizations -- carried it out."
0," At best, it is a tunefully cheerful collection of pop songs with decent animation. At worst, it is a meandering and dull hour and forty minutes of musical theatre that will be grating to anybody over the age of seven. "
1,"It's a sharp, funny, tender and surprising film that pivots on Murray."
0," Voyage of Time is a beautiful diversion, but almost entirely empty, even in its inquisitive big swings for profundity."
1," If ""Hiroshima, Mon Amour"" is best enjoyed for its place in film history, its tragic love story and its haunting black-and-white cinematography, that still makes it a veritable must-see."
0," ...a stupid, unfunny movie that shows that intellectual bankruptcy in the executive suites of Hollywood continues into the 21st century. "
1," Okja pushes Bong Joon Ho's talent for spanning moods and genre conventions to its limit. The movie features his trademark sharp shifts in tone, but also melds Western imagery, music and cultural touchstones."
0," The film as a whole is cold and uninvolving, even with Sophia Loren adding some much-needed Italian authenticity to the retro hollowness."
0, Two hours of recycled plots and plastic acting.
0," I can't imagine the novel's characters were this flat, formulaic and puzzling in their behavior."
1, Further proof that George Clooney is quite simply the movie star of our age.
0," This film is nothing more than a showcase for Loren... but it does little to illuminate the Israeli cause, which was handled better in Exodus and Cast a Giant Shadow."
0," La cinta se vuelve bastante lenta, dando la impresión de estar en un mal sueño"
0," Opens with a horrific traffic accident, which seems apt since what follows is the cinematic equivalent of rubbernecking."
0, A strong ensemble-with one notable exception-is the main attraction of this otherwise slight and unmemorable period comedy.
0," A big, overblown wazoo of absurdity."
1, This look at how screwed up the French legal system is can be harrowing.
1," A powerful story well acted by a fine cast, it doesn't have the moral outcome you might imagine. An absorbing drama with a different, albeit downbeat, twist to it."
0," Hollow, uninteresting and false. "
1," Manages to break free from heavy iron genre chains and provide a spooky event that might not send the average viewer screaming out of the theater, but it could induce some heavy fingernail chewing during the ride."
0," Sandler's best in awhile, but that's a pretty low bar to go by. Had a lot of potential that's wasted by the usual Happy Madison shtick. "
0," while The Muppet Movie is certainly entertaining, the shift to a coherent, linear, feature-length narrative deprives the film the show's brilliantly structured inanity"
1," Uplifting journey through physical and fantastical worlds which also doubles as a cynic's worst nightmare, beware, this film contains optimism"
0,"Up until about the halfway mark of this movie, I was having a very good time. Then, somehow, it ran out of energy."
0," I never would have guessed that I would say this, but The Wolfman could have benefited from less Del Toro and more CGI."
1,"[Boasts] a concise, witty script, an extremely likeable and attractive group of performers, and an abundance of exciting, well-staged kung-fu combat scenes."
0," Veteran American indie filmmaker Kevin Smith tries his hand at semi-sinister horror with Tusk, a so-so offering where cleverness is often cancelled out by laziness."
1, Take a chance on it - and take your mom.
0," It would be easy to carp about the predictability of this film and its lack of freshness, originality and compelling characters, and point out that Posey would have made a better Lois. But what's the point?"
1," A solid film that rouses simply because the story is so incredible, while Bond star Craig is a charismatic presence throughout."
1, Captures perfectly and expands on the colorful but pessimist junkie pop lover style set by Fight Club and Trainspotting in a modern time. [Full review in Spanish]
0," This kind of comedy should look effortless, but everybody here is working very, very hard."
0," Buy the kids the soundtrack, skip the cynical movie "
0, Soccer moms will find eye candy Gerard Butler good to look at if they can stay awake through his movie. 
1," With a head on its shoulders and the rawest emotions in its craw, Arthur Miller's stage hit The Crucible has become a cinematic grabber for grown-ups -- without that castor oil taste."
1, Youth's conflicted narrative conveys the loss of innocence of its young characters fascinatingly.
1," Bright, concise and to the point."
1," The picture's saving grace is Hit-Girl, an exuberant cinematic original destined to become iconic. Without her, as the saying goes, the makers would have nothing."
0, made with too much optimism
1, A drug-fueled caper that doesn't stint on chronically loopy characters and ridiculously funny situations.
1," For those unfamiliar with contemporary Romanian cinema, Metabolism is a hardcore immersion into distinctly innovative storytelling."
0,Silly nonsense.
1," With its mix of World War II nostalgia, Bam-Pow comic book sensibilities, underdog determination and red-white-and-blue battle scenes, Captain America: The First Avenger is the best Marvel superhero flick since the first Iron Man."
0," A surface-level farce of the contemporary art market which never truly breaks away... At times, the film gives the impression of a broken record."
0," The acting is pretty good, and the characters are interesting, but the screenplay lacks the imagination it takes to elevate this story above the ordinary, predictable level of a common ghost story. It doesn't help this was also done on the cheap."
1," The jokey demeanor that informed the first film remains, even if writer-director James Gunn forces too many gags. But the freshness of the characters remains intact, and the actors continue to interact in a manner that supports the narrative spine."
0," It takes a callused soul not to dread the inevitable, and it takes an exceptional film to earn that discomfort from its audience. This film is not exceptional."
1," In a career of poor choices, perhaps this one was the worst. Oh sure, it made money, but it also turned Emilio Estevez into Leslie Nielsen."
1," Noelle is a millennial Dirty Harry, tackling the social problems that face this generation in a story that's outsized in nature but metaphorically pierces right at the heart of the matter."
1, Undeniably fast and wickedly witty.
1,The Bourne Identity is a quality film that works and it fulfills many of the cinematic wishes that critics and audiences regularly complain are not being fulfilled by studio films.
1," Evoke[s] another era of cinema, so that moviegoers with long memories may have the nicer ride."
1," Smart, mature film about love, lust, and more."
1," The allegorical simplicity of The Planet of the Apes films has always been their greatest strength, of course, and the way this film continues to make us root for Ceasar is a neat trick."
0, The Glass Castle wants to be an old-fashioned weepy but the story borders more on horror.
1," This is still better than most of the action flicks the major studios have released this year and fun enough for those who are fans of the first film and the spy genre, but unfortunately it's not quite golden."
0,This is as formulaic a comedy as humanly possible. Smith's charm and his collaberation with James produce enough laughs to save it from terminal derivativity.
1," A horribly credible, chillingly beautiful and wholly uncompromising drama. It's the end of the world, all right, but no one feels in the least bit fine."
1," Jonathan Demme has struck a brilliant balance here, delivering a film that looks, sounds and feels painfully honest, while making it entertaining as well as deeply truthful."
1," The father-son narrative is given as much prominence as the muscular action story, giving the film a satisfying and entertaining tone - with a payoff"
1,"A true, fine and involvingly human piece of work."
0," Genial, inconsequential, deeply odd but not quite ""quirky."""
1, How far would you go to save your child's life? How far should you go? Those are the questions posed and largely ducked in this film based on the book by Jodi Picolt.
1, The Devil and Daniel Johnston is an unflinching yet loving look at the outsider musician's life. It's also the most revealing look at genius and mental illness since Terry Zwigoff's 1994 documentary Crumb.
1," Prince-Bythewood largely stays away from grandiloquent gestures designed to manipulate audience emotions, relying instead on sound storytelling and a set of accomplished performers to punch across the story's humanist appeal."
0," ...gives plenty of space to Foley's sad, lonely music, yet as a piece of evangelism, the film didn't convince me."
1," The greatest mystery of all -- why this family believed the imposter and welcomed him ""home"" -- remains hauntingly unsolved"
1," In the movie's best scene, as mother and son dance to an old pop song, the look on Reynor's face speaks volumes about loss and hope. It's a look that's going to be breaking hearts on screen for decades to come."
1, Government sanctioned atrocities and journalist Jeremy Scahill fight for top billing in this investigative doc.
1," Combining stunning technical achievement with a thoroughly gripping story and terrific performances, this is a sensational thriller that demands to be seen."
1," A middling effort by the Coen Brothers' standards is still a damn good film, and that is exactly what Hail, Caesar! is."
1, [Clarkson] makes yearning palpable. She turns mysterious silences into a language of love.
0, Only die hard Jean-Luc Godard fans could appreciate this failed experiment. I am not a die hard fan.
0," Because Mr. Clooney can't figure out what kind of story this is, he too often slips into pandering mode, including in his own performance, which is filled with too many smiles and speeches."
0,[The actors] stand around mouthing dry as Martian dust dialogue.
0," Although it's not as hermetic and impenetrable as The Master, Inherent Vice still comes off as a giant inside joke to anyone who hasn't read Pynchon's novel."
1," Its sepia-tinted bones are weathered, but spit-shined real nice, sporting an all-star cast and a gold mine of studio production value."
1," More than 100 million Elmo owners can't be wrong, can they?"
1, Fassbender's David is the film's centerpiece. Rapace plays the Hollywood girlfriend role instead of a steely protagonist on a messianic journey. Theron always commits fully to every character she plays.
0," Melinda and Melinda, like its title characters, seems to go nowhere in particular."
0," When you have Berry in a Catwoman costume and Stone in a catsuit, and you can't even stage a decent catfight, why make a Catwoman movie at all?"
1," If the first film was in some ways a re-imagining of Seuss, with a grinchy Gru's heart growing from two sizes too small to one too large, Despicable Me 2 continues his rehabilitation from complete societal outlier to minion-infested community fixture."
1,"Russell is a cool and clever director, with a vision all his own."
0, Faithful to its source but rather unremarkable as a movie experience.
0," This mash-up makes for a curious movie, one both beholden to its many sources of inspiration, and uncertain of how to use them to pave its way forward."
0," As ""meet-cute"" scenarios go, it's one of the more sick and twisted ones out there, not least because it takes all of 30 seconds for the film to forget about Holly and Messer's grief and embrace the hilarity of poop-filled nappy montages."
1,Seeing The Hobbit is like going to a timeshare presentation. First you have to sit through the boring stuff before you can take advantage of the spectacular benefits.
1," Edgy comedy attacks stereotypes; strong language, drinking. "
0, It's no different than watching a third-rate sitcom on a Tuesday night.
0," I hate to say it, but if Judd Apatow wants to be a seriously funny filmmaker, he may have to leave home."
0, Volume 2 loses its energy rather like a sex partner unable to perform.
1," Cold and calculated, but some of its scenes are potent."
0," The action thriller The Mummy, meant to be the Big Bang of Universal's new ""Dark Universe"" franchise, is something of a wet firecracker, more a corporate-driven branding exercise than a living, breathing movie of its own."
1," Watching this pun-filled cartoon is like falling into a tray of children's watercolors -- the warm end, where oranges and yellows and ambers wave."
0, Infamous isn't able to convey the great sense of guilt and responsibility Capote wrestled with -- he needed a man who trusted him to die in order to finish his book -- becoming instead a more superficial and pedestrian tale of doomed love.
0, Great lead. Great premise. Utterly stupid.
0,"It's neither funny nor feelgood, but its biggest crime is wasting Murray, left trying to mine laughs from unfunny circumstances."
1," Rife with unexpected outbursts, moments of catharsis and deeply funny observations about love and sex, this is a film that runs you through the emotional wringer, then shifts into reverse and pulls you back through again."
0," Everything about Click is so predictable that when it is released on home video, you will be able to watch it in a lot less than the 98 minutes it takes to see it in the theater."
0," It's another helping of uber-violence and genial horseplay, an uneasy mix that has become The Expendables' stock in trade..."
0, Not even Steven Spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie.
0," Director Paul McGuigan and screenwriter Max Landis possess an ambition far beyond their range, attempting to graft together pieces of gothic horror, dark comedy, costume drama, existentialist philosophy and CGI adventure."
1," Although the comedy carries the movie, at the heart of it is the surprising message about the burdens placed on women in male-dominated areas."
1," It deals love, death, faith, country, family, friendship and career in a way that's never sentimental, though I defy you to get to the end without shedding a tear."
0," Total Recall is like Bourne Identity met Blade Runner, then had an ugly tabloid breakup followed by a nervous breakdown and a tell-all book."
0," Perilously close to being ""The Space Princess Diaries."""
1, He wrote and sang eloquently of love and its longtime companion loneliness. Blaze touches on the experiences that informed that material.
1," Lucas Hedges, Nicole Kidman , and Russell Crowe lead a superb cast in Joel Edgerton's riveting conversion therapy drama that hits all the right notes."
0," Simmering, yet stilted melodrama, filled with bittersweet nostalgia and a terrific soundtrack."
0," I staggered out of this shameless, interminable movie feeling as if I'd been force-fed a ton of mealy, artificially sweetened baby food."
1, I found myself convinced by both the story and the saga.
0," A warmed-over relic from the 90's incompetently directed by Rob Cohen, Alex Cross is a mess from top to bottom."
0, A con-game comedy that fails to life up to its illustrious predecessors.
0," Five Feet Apart is clearly aspiring to reach the heights of recent projects like John Greene's The Fault in Our Stars, but these kind of narrative stumbles keep it grounded. "
1, With its unrelenting focus on pain and sadness it's undeniably powerful but a little one-dimensional; by denying us a breadth of emotions it's hard to connect with the story in any meaningful way.
1," A humanist hug of a fable, which concludes that while big miracles may happen, it's the everyday 'miracles' people create for one another that really count. "
1," October Sky doesn't seem like much on paper, but it is an entertaining, smart movie that is calculated to satisfy the all-American notion that anyone can do anything as long as he tries hard enough and never stops believing."
0, Jon Spira doesn't extrapolate from his interviewees whether they feel like a true part of the Star Wars universe or mere tag-alongs to a pop-cultural phenomenon.
0," If even half as much effort had gone into character development and plotting as went into character and creature designs, they might have had something worthwhile."
0, A deadweight spiritual thriller.
1," Silly, slapstick fun for youngsters - with a post-credit sequence touting the TV series."
0," It's a tepid, timid affair, sexually, dramatically and politically."
1," Un beau, wildy amusement et un film original ! See this immediately- read on->"
1," It's all fairly slight, when you take a step back from it, but ultimately that's the strength of Looking and its closing movie. They comprise sweet, passing chapters in a small group of ordinary lives."
0," Whilst Smith uses crash zooms and slow motion to evoke the likes of Michael Bay, it just feels clumsy and drawn-out."
0," It's fun enough while it lasts, but somehow, finally, all too much and not enough."
1," The film is lively enough, and its visuals engaging enough, to entertain its young audience."
1," Soderbergh keeps the story straightforward and subdued, rather than layering in the action and the drama. At times it even gets a bit dull."
0, Rogue One is less the fetish object that The Force Awakens is because it at least has the ambitions to create its own character dynamics and plot routes rather than coast on existing ones. 
0, [BRad Pitt] isn't convincing as a squinty caricature in this satire of war and politics.
0, Lightweight script doesn't help a grandiose premise.
0," Blood Fest will find a place to thrive, and that's in the online space. It's GIF-able, and it winks enough at its core audience to satisfy."
1,"I expected to leave my viewing of the film feeling battered and bruised, but instead I felt very peaceful. Seeing the strength required for forgiveness uplifted me."
1," The Good Dinosaur is Disney-Pixar's obligation gift for the holidays, hoping moviegoers remember it's the thought that counts."
1," It's all just right-even if ""just right"" is just O.K."
1," Were this not a documentary, it would all play out like a lazy satire as the easy ironies pile up."
1," Stuart Dryburgh's sweeping panoramas of Canada and Cape Town %u2013 standing in for Nairobi, Papua New Guinea and Hawaii %u2013 deserve to be enjoyed on the big screen."
1," Punk has never been so adorably, girl or Swedish"
0," The Captive recapitulates the arc of Egoyan's career: early promise, followed by arrant misfires."
1," Jackson has made The Hobbit with brio and fun, and Martin Freeman is just right as Bilbo Baggins: he plays it with understatement and charm."
0," ""The Commune"" falls vastly short of its promise, and through a combination of cursory characterization, blunt relationship dynamics, timid sexual politics, and non-existent social commentary, amounts to a nicely lit kitchen-sink soap opera."
1, Walker creates indelible documentary portraits of six workers that round out Muniz's very unusual physical portraits. [Not] the usual saccharine shock at poverty.
0," Cusack and Jackson aren't on their finest acting form, and this is one to forget."
0," Bland, bloodless and bereft of magic."
0," Regardless of a distinct lack of romantic chemistry between Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo, the able-bodied actors fulfill the slapstick demands of this run-of-the-mill family comedy based on the 1968 movie with Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball."
0,"It offers the illusion of originality by bombarding audiences with Greek stereotypes, but really clings to the formulaic romance comedy."
1, It is lovely to look at. It has real sweep. The problem lies with the sometimes clunky dialogue and the occasionally rushed characterisation.
0, The worthwhile subject matter becomes trivialized.
1," We Are the Flesh could inspire evenings of fervent disputation and interpretation, but first there needs to be an audience for it, and for this? I'm not so sure. There was once a time, though."
0, It takes some effort to neutralize the charm of a modestly charismatic Robert De Niro performance. But Everybody's Fine does a stupendous job.
1," A whodunit so nicely crafted that you're tempted to forgive the Byzantine plot -- hell, you're even tempted to pretend you actually understand its twisting obscurities."
1," The product of Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Once Upon a Time, Cinema, is an indulgence and a Valentine to movies."
0, Feardotcom invents a whole new kind of bad.
0, Dr Seuss' eco-fable is transformed into a raucous adventure comedy in this colourful animated feature. And it's a little embarrassing really.
0, Worst movie of the year. Six writers. Only four get credit. Moses and God aren't listed. But this is so bad it probably doesn't bother Moses and God anyway.
1, The strength of this third manifestation of The Hunger Games is in the cast and in the screenplay.
1," Jia draws a fine line between the corporeal and ethereal, a fitting means of highlighting the inherent unbelievability of one's way of life disappearing underwater."
0, This would be so much better if it was actually funny. 
0," Though often swank, it might be too harsh and clammy to be a natural high, unless you're deep into species masochism."
0," This first film by writer/director Jonathan Kasdan reveals him to have a good ear for dialogue and the foibles of growing into adulthood. With the inclusion of greater originality in his plotlines, he should grow into a director to watch."
1, This whale of a film will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the best films of 2003.
1," What Astro Boy has in spades are energy, good humor, and the demolition-derby action of a superhero smash-up, reasons enough to recommend it to grade-school boys."
0," Criminal acts and scenes of brutal violence spoil the effect of ""Barnyard"" as an animated movie for tots."
1, Anton Walbrook is on peerlessly maniacal form.
0, An already thin veneer of historical truth wears off fairly quickly in this surprisingly dull and melodramatic low-budget western.
0, Depp's strenuously unfunny performance turns a frivolous caper comedy into a grim death march to the closing credits.
1, A heartbreaking story of an 11-year-old deserted by his dad.
0, More curdled nostalgia than cinematic excitement.
0, The Visitor is a terrible film.
1," A solid plot, one with credible sci-fi twists but also heart. It throws off the jokiness in which this series has been mired to create action-adventure in service to story. "
1,Brings a lot of talent and a tremendous amount of craft to a movie that will be too painful for most people to endure. 
1," An engaging journey to the dark side, thanks to Robert Pattinson's lead turn, which adds a layer of emotional resonance to what ends up an uncommonly intriguing crime drama."
0, The tone's too rough to be funny. Kick-Ass 2 suffers from being a little too real.
1, A delicate comedy that deals with a subject that cinema has shown little interest in explore. [Full review in Spanish]
1, It almost manages to restore (at least temporarily) one's faith in both the democratic process and Kevin Costner's career.
0," This is the dumbest, gruntiest, schlockiest film ever to be cut and pasted off the internet"
1,"Secret Window"" is taut, credible, and thoroughly entertaining, and features another eccentric -- and uncommonly good -- performance from Johnny Depp."
0," Dated, quirky adaptation of video game has some violence."
1, It's a superficial publicity piece. But it's enjoyable even if you're not a pre-pubescent girl.
0," Political correctness, flamethrowers and Wagner!"
1,The movie is such an immersive portrayal of an insular world rarely seen onscreen that the thin story isn't a major problem. 
0," The fanciful associations and bad jokes are more often stupid than silly, making all the spectacle and contrived dance numbers seem a colossal waste."
1, A pleasant familial drama spiced with a keen appreciation for the surprising twists and turns of romantic love.
1," Watching Sally Field is one of the pleasures of going to the movies. 'Doris' doesn't always give her the material she deserves. But even when the film fails her, Field never fails to shine. "
0, Ms. Kidman goes through it all as if impersonating an adorable trick-or-treater.
0," If you can't survive on muscles, carnage and brutality alone, and need even the slightest bit of heart, look elsewhere as 'Conan' is as brash and coarse as its hero."
0," Mediocre action, various plot holes, and questionable character behavior, occasionally horrid dialogue, and a cast that appears bored. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - Also Available)"
1," ""Chronicle"" is a compact movie that teases us about where it's headed, pays off satisfyingly and leaves us with a lingering thought: Be careful what superpowers you wish for."
1, A fascinating film.
0, More of an infield grounder than a home run.
1," A film you expect to be funny given the comedic talent attached, but surprisingly it is also strangely moving as well."
1," Mr. Kusturica, whose own best directing days may be behind him, nevertheless gives a terrific portrayal of a man living inside his head and his history..."
0," A fine setup for two strong-willed characters to have at each other... Yet Green Book wears thin, and how could it not, since it's basically an illustrative construction in which each scene has a predictable shape and a clear-cut purpose."
1," The film would rather give us an earned smile than strain fruitlessly for a guffaw, and its humor is much more dialogue- and character-driven than goofy"
1,"An often amusing, harmless adventure with enough inoffensive humor and impressive CGI animation to make up for its lack of exhilarating moments and refreshing surprises."
1," This scenario allows free rein for patented Key and Peele riffing on race, rap and drug stereotypes while also freestyling on pop-cult obsessions ..."
1, It helps that the script was penned by Schumer. undoubtedly one of the most prominent comedians of her generation. [Full review in Spanish]
0, How can a teen romantic fantasy not be at least some fun when the leading man's lipstick is several shades redder than that of the ingénue?
1," Miyazaki offers a vivid, at times fantastical view of Japan between the wars, wracked by the Great Depression, a fearsome earthquake that leveled Tokyo in 1923, a tuberculosis epidemic and the rise of fascism."
0," It traffics in computer-generated vomit, a surprising number of defecation gags, and a weird grudge against both the overweight and the bearded."
1, Foxcatcher is one of the bleakest visions ever about the American Dream in a mainstream movie.
0," A film where everything is disjointed in an eternal reiteration of the same. The style, in effect, kills. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, My Boss's Daughter is a stinker from start to endless finish.
1,Exceptional...the effect is shattering.
1, ... in that fast-and-loose reiteration of facts are some fine performances.
0,"The Darkest Minds"" is in desperate need of a spark, any spark. References to ""Watership Down"" and ""Harry Potter"" only serve to show how far this film is from the classics it admires."
1," Visual artist Sam Taylor-Wood casts aside her moody conceptual art and directs a lively, insightful and slightly nostalgic look at the drama of John Lennon's formative years and his relationship with the two women who brought him up."
0," He takes refuge in gross-out humour, running gags about dog poo and assumptions about male bonding that seem ridiculously immature, given the ages of the actors."
0, Van Damme may be famous enough that he can afford to continue noodling around with different roles and performance styles. But his fellow cast members deserve a lot better than We Die Young.
1, A subtly comic tale that in effect takes 'About Schmidt' forward by 15 years.
1," Everything is covered with Zappa's own words, with the interviews showing the candor that made the artist so beloved by some and misunderstood by others."
0, This latest offering of offings is a slight improvement over some feeble recent work.
0, A horrifically dreadful vampire teensploitation entry.
1," Llewyn is a beautiful loser, the everyman artist who contributes to the evolution of music and helps set the stage for a Dylan but never reaps the final reward, punched out by a world ready to swoop in on his scene and leave him behind."
0, A somewhat disappointing and meandering saga.
1," Mr. Brooks has a crisp, clever script, lacings of black humour, heart-racing pacing and convincing performances."
0," Even with Martin Sheen's impressive Chris Cringle facial hair, The Vessel annoys and irritates more than anything else. The film may be alluring to look at, but it's absolutely torturous to endure and practically unbearable to watch."
0, I don't know what's more disappointing; this movie not being scary or not being focused on the electronic music group of the same name.
1," The spare, humanist influence of Ozu is plain to see here, but Fukada's tone is all his own, simultaneously shot through with violence and compassion."
0, Kevin Smith gets his weird on
0,"Since it's too much a crowd-pleaser to be critical of the violent payoff that it delivers, it's tough not to take its apparent message seriously."
1," Wildly funny and inventive, a giddy re-imagining of martial-arts flicks that might be one of the most audaciously entertaining films of the year."
1," A brazen sequel that's both slightly disappointing and a reliable, often riotous ""laffer"" in the old Variety trade-magazine parlance."
1," Pawlikowski treats the girls' escalating attraction with delicacy, avoiding the titillating pitfalls of the genre."
1," United 93 presses hard on raw nerves and then, in its final frame, it literally crushes them. What Greengrass has created is haunting and unshakable, the medium at its full potential."
1,"Most times the tropes of gothic horror work well, particulary the ones relative to the geography and scenery. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Not a bath, after sitting through this hyperactive mess of a movie I'm not sure I'll ever be able to take a bath again, but getting clean will definitely still be a priority."
1," May be the best Farrellys movie yet, even though it doesn't live up to the pair's usual level of uproarious, crass comic genius."
1, Weird and arresting.
1,"Based on Andre Aciman's novel, this gorgeous-looking and beautifully atmospheric film has echoes of all sorts of good things, including Guadagnino's A Bigger Splash and I Am Love. "
0, It's a downer -- and far more because of Aronofsky's vanity than because of Selby's brutally candid story.
0," Fast out of the gate but slowing in the back stretch, this film will need witchcraft to keep all but the hardiest fans awake for the final kiss."
0," The movie returns to its regularly scheduled programming: a rote summer bummer where, ironically enough, events feel more preordained the more Greengrass recycles his patented brand of faux-vérité realism. "
0," A mostly tedious, would-be scary movie that contains a few decent jump scares, but is undone by a filmmaking team unable to expand on the creepy events of the first film. (Full Content Review - Sex, Violence, Profanity, etc. - for Parents available)"
0," Die Another Day comes at a time when the marketplace is already full of action-heavy spy movies, some of which out-Bond James Bond."
1," Creep isn't particularly gory -- certainly not for a horror film. Rather, Josef's eccentricities surface in surprising ways that, while not bloody, are certainly horrifying and strangely funny."
1,"Virtually hitch-free, making it a true cinema valentine."
0, The pleasure of seeing a supergroup of Brit-veterans soon withers in an OAP comedy that plumps for light laughs over deeper insights.
0," The script is stale, but the gags are downright rancid."
0, There's an undercurrent of anger and nastiness throughout that's frankly disturbing. Humiliation is the name of the game.
0," Like a lemon that's been tricked out with a fancy paint job, Fast & Furious won't stand up to much scrutiny under the hood."
0," Evil Dead suffers the curse of its own mediocrity: while it is really not bad, it would linger longer in the viewer's mind if it were better - or indeed worse. As it is, the fun ride is over and forgotten as soon as its brisk 90 minutes have elapsed."
1," ...a grandly infectious animated showcase that radiates with genuine wit and warmth. Imaginative, riotous and inherently clever..."
0," The farther I got from the queasy beauty of McQueen's movie, the more I hated it."
1," This is the best thriller of the year so far. Exciting, interesting, gripping and impossible not to get sucked into, this is a great movie."
0," The Saw franchise has become a weekend-before-Halloween tradition; ironically, though, it has ceased to be a horror series."
1, Those who fancy a bit of hellfire on their Christmas pudding will find this a welcome respite from the seasonal diet of intestine-clogging goo.
0," You can understand why someone would detest the person who wrongs them, though it's hard to take [the dialogue] seriously, and keep a straight face when even someone as competent as Joshi is spouting it."
1," It takes a while for The Heat to warm up, but after about 30 minutes of straining-for-effect comedy, this buddy cop vehicle for Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy proves a much funnier proposition than the thinness of its premise suggests."
1," There's an argument to be made that there's a calculated degree of cliché to this sweet, Southern-fried fairytale, that Nichols is paying tribute here to his more mainstream inspirations."
1," Split is funnier, campier, and more freewheeling than anything its writer-director has done-slightly overlong, but reminiscent of Brian De Palma films like The Fury and Femme Fatale in its refusal to be boring."
0, This mangy sequel just isn't up to scratch.
0," ""Stoker"" is a thriller in which the big question is not ""What will happen next?"" but rather ""What is going on?"""
1," ""For the Plasma"" may frustrate some people by erring too much on the side of the enigmatic, especially in its final half hour, but it offers up a compelling optimist's vision of the forest of life, before which we're all searching for answers."
0," Presents an interesting case for the post-apocalyptic film as the re-birth of the western, but beyond that it's pretty dumb."
0, The most January movie to ever January.
0, Overall the film falls flat.
1," The most underrated American director this side of Richard Linklater, Nicole Holofcener, continues to be a master of The Moment: a tiny but meaningful exchange or look or gesture that conveys more emotion than any awards-bait monologue could."
1," Larsson's genius was to suggest a connection between those cruel but supposedly dead ideologies and a continuing legacy of misogyny, rape and violence against women."
1," Mockingjay - Part 1 is just big enough of a story that, even as a two-parter, the film feels substantial and justifiably halved. There's simply too much to digest as all the pieces are put into place and the real games are set to begin."
0," Without the interactive component, we're just watching moldy movie tropes retranslated back into movie form. And by the end, the craven franchise aspirations have obliterated even the very modest retro appeal."
0," Every frame of the way, it's eminently clear that Primer is the work of an engineer, not a film- maker."
0, The subtext is easy to follow; it's the screenplay that's impossible.
1, John G. Young might have very well made the film that best encompasses what online dating feels like.
0," If (this) sounds like entertainment to you, perhaps you should save the price of admission and put it toward therapy."
1," It's pleasant and honourable, and it makes a worthwhile point. But it's strangely lacking in urgency, a period piece that never breaks out of its period."
0," Ho-hum zombie mayhem lurks around every bend, but the movie's comic tone becomes increasingly strained."
0," Along with writing partner Ernest Riera, Roberts pilfers odds and ends of Hindu religious practices and folklore to construct a middling ghost story that traces a vaguely Gothic outline, only to follow a wearyingly derivative trajectory."
0, Just another dumb riff on The Exorcist ...
1, This is hands down my favorite animated film of 2009.
0,"Frankly, it's painful to watch such a strong cast struggle so desperately to hold the film together while it falls apart around them"
0, Gives us an overly simplistic twofold message. Alma was hot. And she was a supreme rhymes-with-witch.
1,Hilarious.
1," It's not a good film, but it's a funny one."
0," Un nuevo fiasco de M. Night Shyamalan, que sigue siendo un director con ideas interesantes (tanto argumentales como visuales) pero que necesita urgentemente la ayuda de un buen guionista."
0, Plays more like a metaphor in search of a movie than a particularly great showcase for the often underused Scottish star.
0, It is hard to imagine what possible point there was in turning it into a movie. Nothing MOVES.
1," Movie about ""old"" friends has heart and hilarity."
1, A formulaically entertaining combination of gorgeous cinematography and unapologetic anthropomorphization.
0," Lurie makes the same point as Peckinpah, namely that, when survival is threatened, even the most civilised types have a primal capacity for violence. But, 40 years on, the shock factor has gone."
1," An unlikely proposition on paper, this Arnold Schwarzenegger-Abigail Breslin zombie movie offers a moving twist on the genre."
0, The worst installment of the worst Pixar franchise. [Full review in Spanish]
1,It's at its best when the bickersome Mr. Black and Ms. Blanchett trade insults about their begone heydays. 
1," Here, Williams has a chance to do some of the most integral, gentle and praiseworthy acting of his career. "
1, It takes a long time getting to the final shootout.
0, What remains unchanged about the director and his team is that craftsmanship is obviously not a critical concern for them.
0," It's what might be heart-sinkingly called a modern-day fairytale - but the kind of modern-day fairytale that gets both halves of the equation wrong, giving you something twee and improbable, weighted down by a dreary yet unconvincing realism."
1," It's novel, it's entertaining, it's funny, it's witty, and though it revolves around one brand of toy, it never actually feels like one giant commercial."
0,"If it bleeds, we can kill it"", Arnie said of the original monster. Perhaps it's finally time to finally put this bleeding, limping series out of its misery for good."
1, A brutal Russian masterpiece.
0," I'd say Gone is a shoo-in for one of the worst movies of 2012, except no one will remember it even existed by December."
1, Makes for [an] entertaining watch before succumbing to the same bombastic overkill.
0,[Writer-director Craig Brewer] displays a real passion for the music and a knack for using it to create mood. But it's not enough to overcome the thinness of his characters or the greeting card sentiment that pulls the rug out from what came before.
1," The doc flags toward the end, but it remains an absorbing snapshot of a daring time."
0," Women He's Undressed strives to be a cheeky jaunt through Orry-Kelly's illustrious career, but the man himself would undoubtedly be horrified to have been caught dead in this off-the-rack dreck."
0," If all the boys really do love Mandy Lane, I must be the exception."
0, Watching Raimi's visual style and narrative verve flatten out into this pale reiteration of a middle-aged-male weepie is an exercise in modern horror.
0," In a word, exhausting. In a few more, overblown, overstuffed, repetitive, bombastic, and sometimes just dumb. (Never mind dreary to look at and punishing to hear.)"
0, Halfway through and I'm looking for my own escape. 
1,Christopher learns too late that one must love and fear nature in equal measure and that happiness is meaningless without someone with whom to share it.
1," This is a wildly romantic biographical drama about the great poet widely known by his pen name, Pablo Neruda. Years before his downfall, we see Neruda the artist, Neruda the romantic, Neruda the trickster, foiling the dark powers with wit and courage."
1, Two and a quarter hours of lycanthropic hokum with fun moments.
1,"A banquet of delicious performances, a sharp situational comedy, and an acrid send-up of contemporary mores."
0, It's probably appropriate that a film about adolescent identity crises has trouble figuring out what it wants to be.
0," On a scene-by-scene basis, much of Chicken With Plums delivers satisfactorily, but it adds up to much less than the sum of its many parts."
0, [An] aimless period drama.
0, A British version of those old Hollywood films about bigotry that always decried how terrible it used to be in the South.
1," Littered with amusing set-pieces involving bumbling state functionaries, the film's comedy is executed with a flair for comic timing, yet there's no escaping the ensuing laughter is tinged with a heavy sense of apprehension."
1," Certainly no biopic, Nijinsky is short on facts, but long on expression."
1," An empathetic, often heartbreaking piece of work."
0, ...a minor addition to the Schwarzenegger oeuvre
1," While the film might not be for everyone, it offers a sensitive and visually appealing look at the trials that a transgender person often has to face in the world."
0," Full of half-truths (e.g., the French government his characters praise was thrown out of office after the film wrapped), this is just more of Moore's pathetic propaganda"
0," I honestly wish it could change itself into a good movie, instead it ends up being one of the worst sequels I've ever seen."
1," Amirpour never lets a message get in the way of a good tune, taking palpable delight in spinning the reels like a cinematic DJ, keeping the crowd on their toes, wrong-footing their dance moves."
1, Very charming and certainly close to the bone.
0," ...being point blank for Brolin delivering the horrendous dialogue coaxed me to exclaim aloud - ""this guy is dumb as a post."""
1," Of all the supposedly challenging attractions playing locally in our supposedly more enlightened era, the most compellingly erotic and entertaining spectacle is still provided by Belle de Jour"
0," It's just a disappointing, half baked follow up that could have aimed higher."
1," Every generation gets the ""Network"" it deserves. For ours, obsessed with self-actualization, fame and personal branding, we get the disturbingly funny satire ""Welcome To Me."""
0," Whilst it suffers from a lack of focus at times, it's a well-made and thought-provoking insight into our strange new world."
1," ""I Origins"" has the genetic markers of a formulaic supernatural thriller, and it's marred by some muddy metaphysics and fuzzy science, but the beauty is in the details."
1," Beautifully quirky, taboo, and British."
1," Represents a certain moral improvement over its predecessors by refusing to celebrate and condemn violence and duplicity in the same breath, or at least to the same degree."
1," It's a testament to Malick's filmmaking skill that we do become somewhat engaged in Jack's childhood struggles with his father's authority, his mild Oedipal issues and his other growing-up issues. "
1," Ooh, boy, this movie's got the funk AND the soul."
0," The story is idiotic, the dialogue moronic and the characters are cardboard cutouts. Stupid cardboard cutouts."
1," The entirety of human existence in two short years, all of it brought to life in an extraordinary motion picture that's absolutely impossible to forget."
1," Ambiguity is The Falling's currency, and it's all the richer for it."
0, The giddy fun implied by that preposterous moniker is missing in this almost entirely humourless affair.
1," Depressing, but beautifully crafted."
0, This one had the same paucity in wit and script issues as the whole Shrek series.
1," The dynamic between the sullen Smith and sincere Bateman may be the best thing in the Peter Berg's movie, but it's a tough call because the whole popcorn fest is flat-out fantastic."
1," A sharply drawn study of down-and-outness that dovetails neatly, alas, with the Great Recession fallout that's raining across the land."
0, It's as good as any animated feature about two teenage morons could ever hope to be.
0," Once your hero's crisis is whether or not to pity f@!# card-carrying bombshell Monica Bellucci, you might as well have unicorns and gnomes running around"
1," Fits perfectly into the world created by the first five movies: sentimental, formulaic and effective."
1,In some ways it's beyond criticism as the first-ever major movie about this heroic campaigner.
1," Like toothpaste from a tube, every last laugh is squeezed from this absurd premise, where both men pushing forty act like they're 14. Surprisingly, it's enough to make it work."
1," Eye-opening stuff, in every sense."
0,"For a documentary about a music festival, Soul Power doesn't include nearly enough music."
0, There's a weird love story between them [Paul and Ngoc Lan Tran] inserts itself into an already boring plot. But even that is not as alarming as the hyperbole thrust in our faces. 
1," The different Patersons combine into a terrific take on love's abiding worth, the mechanics of creativity and the strength of community. The film has Jarmusch's trademark deadpan deliberation, but it's also possessed of a great and genuine heart."
0," David Ayer's film longs to be bad, yet its forced by outside pressures to follow narrow, preset rules."
1," A deeply intelligent, wildly entertaining sequel that proves the summer blockbuster is capable of evolution, too."
1," The movie is a stunner, so hypnotic that the length hardly matters."
0, Is the movie scary? Only if this is your first scary movie.
0, It's like a greatest hits of the torture porn genre that never builds up and feels repetitive. [Full review in Spanish]
1," Rude as hell, funny as hell...While merrily delivering all the coarse anti-PC humour the Family Guy fanbase have a right to expect, the best thing about Ted is also its biggest surprise - it has real heart."
1,Entertaining adaptation of Michael Crichton's sexual harassment thriller.
1," Depp is a charm. He becomes his own, subtly compelling Barrie."
1,"Successfully captures the frenzied angst and boredom of youth, as well as the powerful, unbridled emotions of first love."
0, This popcorn thriller has a bit of imagination blended in with the been-done-before action.
1, Amy Schumer shines in an adorable fantasy that both draws from and slyly subverts the classic Cinderella story.
1, Christopher Hampton's pared-back screenplay and Christophe Beaucarne's ravishing lensmanship locate the action in a reality that is only a blink away from the simmering landscape of the unconscious.
1," After enduring a lot of jokes about May-December romances, Douglas comes bouncing back with one of his best performances."
1, It plays like an infomercial plugging the newest in digital filmmaking.
0," As for the inevitable romance between the seemingly sensible Julie and the wispy, lisping Leon, it's sort of like watching her fall for the gay best friend from a whole other movie."
0, One of the worst Stephen King adaptations ever...
0,"In the film, Alvin and the Chipmunks proudly align themselves not with Dr. Demento, but with Kidz Bop."
1," It's better than Juno, I think: more layered, more interesting."
1," Kunis and Timberlake achieve the trickier feat of looking just as happy hanging out as they do sucking face, and when the clichés inevitably come rolling in, they feel earned rather than like a cop-out."
1, craft in every scene and through every swerve is absolutely spellbinding. 
0, A pair of very strong performances can't keep The Theory of Everything from succumbing to the stultifying gravity of biopic conventions.
1, An honest portrait of a delicate subject that is far from becoming a parody or a stereotype. [Full review in Spanish] 
0," It's nice to see righteous anger in a movie. If only the education drama ""Detachment"" knew what to do with it."
0, Would it kill a tough girl to crack a smile or eat a Twinkie or make a pass once in a while? Does she have to be a squinty jerk with intimacy issues in order to be considered super?
1, It is a harsh story and the filmmakers do not try to sugarcoat or diminish its power and tragedy.
1,Enjoyable little film that nonetheless already feels overrated.
0," A cold, hard business story, reshaped by Disney into a warm, fuzzy hug."
0, The Judge deserves to be held in contempt. It's one of the worst movies of the year.
0," About half of the jokes in it made me laugh or at least giggle, while the other half of the jokes fell flat on their face. The movie is funny, but not consistently so."
0, Though it's an admirable tale ... it isn't all that interesting.
1," It's one of those revolting, raunch-fueled movies churned out in their sleep by the Farrelly brothers and Judd Apatow that I usually hate, but with real cleverness, off-center wit and edgy imagination."
1," Regardless of how you feel about the movie's message, you're certain to leave the movie feeling something about the movie itself."
0," In the end, it's more a role-playing game scenario than a plot -- although there someone would have worked out rules that make sense."
0," Many fine talents are thrown into this witch's cauldron of chopped-off bits from other horror films, but it doesn't cohere."
1, ... it is a film that is enjoyed from its commencement. [Full review in Spanish]
1, Arrietty offers the sort of quality storytelling that seems effortless yet is rarely achieved within the animated medium.
0," Being the fifth annual go-round for this durable splatter franchise, this film has really no power to change any minds."
0, A boring and distancing affair!
1, Interesting fact-based adventure with a potentially awards-worthy performance by Wasikowsa. 
1," You watch ""Green Book"" wishing it were a little better but nonetheless enjoying how very good much of it is, thanks to Mortensen and Ali, who make every moment sing."
1, Hardy and Rapace provide a solid emotional anchor as a couple brought together by fear and tightened by survival instinct.
1, For what it aspires to be -- and we're not talking Sense and Sensibility here -- it works.
0," Sounds intriguing, but the actual movie is strangely plain, eyesore-overlit and uselessly frantic."
0," True to its title, ""The Purge"" is an unpleasant experience with no one to care about or root for. What you expect to happen happens. Like most home-invasion thrillers, it's more nauseating than frightening."
0, How shocked can you be by the eventual deceits and betrayals when you've been endlessly warned that NOTHING IS WHAT IT SEEMS?
1," Swank makes it look easier than it probably should be. She's equally charming and vulnerable, which were evidently a couple of the traits of the real-life Earhart. And that's a good thing, because the film often sputters, sways and wobbles..."
0," The first half is magical, captivating, inviting, great cinema. Second half disappoints."
0," Another artfully dull take on vampire lore, one that rather self-consciously tries to outclass Twilight and its ilk, yet still completely fails to be in any way seductive."
0, Violent to the point that to recommend this film to any Disney-loving kid would perhaps taint said child's opinion of the Mouse House for life.
1," There's little about Chao-Bin's other work to suggest the splendidly choreographed ballets of swordplay that feature here, with Woo's dexterous hand obvious in the fight scenes."
0," All of the structural, if superficial aspects of the story are in place, but the film fails to dig deeper, giving talented veteran actors very little to work with."
0," Flower is redeemed only by Zoey Deutch's magnetic performance, which would be star-making if in the service of a better vehicle."
1," A comedy that plays like a cross between Henry Jaglom, Kevin Smith and the Duplass brothers with droll rambling humor and emotional honesty."
0," Even for a Hallmark movie, Jamie and Sawyer are stiff robots."
0," A low-key, odd-couple comedy built mostly around Nelson's coarse ad-libs and Eenhoorn's sighing reactions."
0," The only plausible scenario in this movie is the idea that a woman would be so annoyed by Dane Cook, she'd be willing to put a curse on him."
0," With all the digital and environmental tomfoolery, it's a shock that Chipwrecked wasn't released in 3D, and that renders it ever so slightly more respectable. But seriously, Jason Lee, you're so much better than this. Please, stop now."
0," Cool to look at, but there's nothing to it."
1," Genuinely bleak and upsetting in places, this is a horror intent on both shocking audiences and inspiring awe."
0," When the film ultimately does deliver on the threat of a flood, there's not much to think other than that the special effects are adequate and that Carell's movie is one big washout."
0,"So filled with mixed messages, misguided plot turns, and consecutive false denouements that, by the actual end, it finally comes off as nothing but an infuriating betrayal."
0," The Cossack horseback action sequences are impressive, but there are too few shots of thundering hooves and too many scenes of stilted political discourse for this picture to take flight."
1,"non-stop, unadulterated raunchiness, with a handful of parodies and unwholesome musical numbers thrown in for good measure."
1," Equal parts sweetness, melancholy and rage, Milk is a wonderfully immersive, warts-and-all journey into the gay community at a vital moment in civil rights history."
0," The original had us glued to our sears with tension but here the drama doesn't induce any goosebumps. Also, the film is choppily edited and hence the narration looks disjointed."
0, It's so aggressive you don't even have to like it; the movie likes itself well enough for the both of you.
1," Polar isn't for everyone, but you can't say it pulls any punches."
1,"Even though it may not be Almodovar's best film, it is still eminently watchable and thoroughly enjoyable."
1, It's a film that pays off the viewer again and again and again.
0, Owes more to 'The War of the Worlds' than the war of ideas that made the first 'Matrix' stand out...
1," I enjoyed ""Gods of Egypt"" despite the lazily generic non-story, the dubious Eurocentric casting and (intentionally?) unconvincing effects that make you wonder (another imponderable) why they didn't just make this an animated picture."
0, Terminator Genisys feels like being trapped in a conversation with a child breathlessly recounting the highlights of the preceding movies.
0," Defiance makes a noise but leaves no echo. It feels progressively more bogus and less significant the further it recedes from view, and myths are meant to wax in the memory, not wane."
0, There's something sad about seeing a character as sweet and simple as good ol' Charlie Brown so totally ruined.
1, What Bolt lacks in originality it makes up for in execution.
0, A film that prefers tastefully underplaying Holocaust clichés to building its own legitimate drama.
0, An eye-rollingly clumsy amble through a Middle Earth of Monopolists -- aimed at Ayn Rand cultists and their fellow travelers 
0," You would think that sexy 1930's gangsters using excessive force and chasing around in gorgeous cars would at least be enough to help me forget that I need to do some laundry, but you would be wrong."
1," Aside from Stewart transforming herself into Jett, once the band is formed, there is little about the film that captures the atmosphere of the time period. "
0," Streep may be a hot Oscar favourite but you need more than a star turn to make a good movie, and The Iron Lady isn't likely to please anyone in Britain."
1," This is what it means to go to the theater and watch a big movie made with love, care, and intelligence."
0,We're supposed to be feeling . . . something. That we don't might be Cronenberg's own endgame.
1," A bewitching documentary that mischievously fuses the past with the present, the rich with the poor, the idle with workaholic"
0," Feebly scripted, barely structured, it tells us nothing about why the US Afghan adventure went wrong (if we agree it did)."
1, A bittersweet goodbye with sweeping visuals and a heartfelt ending to one of the best modern animated movie franchises.
0," A high-art snuff film...an unhealthy, inhuman, pornographic, masochistic torture mechanism."
0," Las Vegas steals the show, even though it's played by New Orleans."
0," The movie itself apparently isn't sure the murders themselves are lurid enough. So it adds a few things that didn't happen, plus some 21st-century music."
1, The great irony of Ryan Coogler's Creed is that it is among the more grounded entries in the Rocky series yet acts as a direct sequel to the ultra-fantastical Rocky IV.
0, Horrible movie. One of the five worst films of 2011.
1,"Surprisingly enjoyable comedy with strong comic performances, lively direction and several decent gags."
0," This cheerfully dim-witted film is ultimately a step backwards from its predecessor, the ensemble-driven Why Did I Get Married?"
0," More like an acting seminar than what the press kit calls a 'high-intensity, thought-provoking thriller.'"
0," Suffers in comparison to the tension, subtlety, and top-drawer acting in Infernal Affairs."
1," Great casting makes a great comedy, and some brilliant strokes are served with the sports dramedy, ""Battle of the Sexes."" "
1, Startling and bold!
0," Viggo Mortensen plays ""The Man"" (in the anonymous, Everyman sense, not in the ""Stick it to the..."" blaxploitation sense). Charlize Theron is ""Wife."" Kodi Smit-McPhee is ""The Boy."" And I'm The Audience, and I'm annoyed."
1," While I may not think every aspect works, you cannot help but be impressed that they did not take the easy way out."
0," Five minutes of Carano fighting, 85 minutes of half-baked espionage plotting that nobody, not writer Lem Dobbs or Soderbergh, seems to care much about."
0," For all the movie's narrative momentum, Che retains the air of a study exercise -- of an interest brilliantly explored. How else to explain one's total flatness of feeling at the climax of each movie?"
0," It's so perfectly contrived and mechanical and fresh as a daisy, it's infuriating. And only the sly, insistently subversive Christopher Plummer is on our side."
0," Yes, horror fans, this is one of those movies in which we praise the makeup instead of the plotting, characters, or scares."
1," Lords of Chaos is well acted and worth watching for anyone with a passing interest in the source material, but Åkerlund's subtle direction fails to conjure much tension or sense of dread-something sorely needed to tell this story."
1," Unerring in how it puts us in sufferers' positions, making us feel their terror in palpable, convulsive ways."
1, Any list of classic guy movies would be incomplete without an appearance from Brian De Palma's Scarface.
1," An ultra cute family film catering for the under 12 set, Hop combines live action with the colourful animated world of the Easter bunny as it tells a happy story about families, expectations and dreams"
0," Tere's nothing edgy or new about Run, Fat Boy, Run."
0," Hare's screenplay is efficient at delivering facts, but just the facts. The movie may be competent at telling its story, but it's missing one key ingredient: feeling."
1," ... if there is a word more complimentary than perfect I would have used it, but I can't come up with one. Wait, now that I think about it, maybe masterpiece is that word. Yep, that will suffice. Toy Story 3 is an absolute masterpiece."
0," For all the failings on display, the mighty Marvel machine rolls along."
0," If 'Half-assing your career will get you nowhere' counts as a big lesson for young artists, the music industry is in even bigger trouble than we thought."
1,It has a poise and serenity that prove impressive.
1, Sing Street has a great pace and a fantastic climax that will find you leaving the cinema smiling after a truly excellent Irish film.
1," Reitman handles the material with sensitivity and an unflinching eye for the detail of pregnancy, parenthood and female friendship that's by turns humorous and desperately moving."
0, Fake WMD and super-shaky cam: It's The Paul Greengrass Experience.
0," Bankers have replaced lawyers in the hate chain, at least that is the premise of this movie"
0, Murky storytelling!
0, Let's hope Herbie forgot his passport.
0," The film's hand-held camerawork doesn't build the kind of visual tension a good action movie needs, and Johnson doesn't shape memorable characters so much as sweaty chess pieces, too many of them to keep track of."
1," I won't say this movie is perfect because it's not, as endearing and fussy as it is, but I can tell you that this is a movie with heart."
0, You're better off watching Kingsman and The Breakfast Club back to back and calling it a night.
1," if not a classic, at least memorable as it aspires, but doesn't quite succeed, in being more than just a horror flick as mindless as the roving mutants it showcases"
0, A wit-free comedy that defies classification (and not in a good way). 
1," Frustrating but fascinating, with moments that refuse to be shrugged off"
0, This overlong sequel is short of magic.
1," Of all the movies culminating in a rite of exorcism, Romanian writer-director Cristian Mungiu's remarkable ""Beyond the Hills"" stands alone."
1," A constant fight of one kick forward, one kick backward when it comes to overall quality but it ends on the front foot and so barely works by virtue of leaving the audience with a smile on their face."
0," The characters are written so absent-mindedly that it's on the verge of world record stupidity. Its poor writing, bad acting, and stupidly predictable outcome ruin the few good things You're Next has going for it."
0, The fights are too brief and spaced out while the drama is an outright bore
0," The longer Too Late goes on, the less there is to it."
0," A dumb show annihilated on the electric wire of pretentiousness, The Double recalls too many similar movies for its own good."
0," Kicks off with an inert concept for suspense and proceeds to hog pile on the plot with total abandon, slapping on the whoppers and clichés like a maniac. "
0," The erratic, barely humorous dialogue here is even more ghastly than your average spoof, while Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer's direction is patchy, to say the least."
1," I can hardly recount the many scenes of inspired madness, including the sight of David Hasselhoff shooting across the water like a human hydrofoil."
1," Jenkins is a provocateur to be sure, but she also has a heart, which is why her films don't come across as mean even when dealing comically with issues of death, debilitation, and emotional trauma."
0,As entertaining as watching the last bits of ketchup drip out of the bottle.
1," The Lookout drags itself into four star territory thanks to the startling turn from Gordon-Levitt - a name to, ahem, look out for."
1," We've seen most of this before in countless films, but Scott finds something more than the sheer confusion of the celebrated Normandy battle scene in Saving Private Ryan -- he finds a coarse, hypnotic rhythm all his own."
1," Featuring amazing performances on nearly all counts, deft action and stunning cinematography, Rings is the kind of adventure we don't see every year."
1, I happen to have found the results exhilarating.
0, a hellzapoppin approach to special effects such that any initial exhilaration with same is quickly replaced by a moribund sense of exhaustion [and] glassy-eyed indifference
0," National Treasure: Book of Secrets has the same director as National Treasure, the same writers, and nearly all of the same lead actors. This is no surprise, since it is basically the same movie."
1," The macguffin at the heart of it is preposterous, but frankly incidental: it's the journey that holds us rather than the destination. "
1, Cardinal is the film equivalent of the Southern Ontario Gothic literary genre with its moral decay and realism and the introduction of evil in context of the setting.
1, As disconcerting as the film's start is... it takes off like the Millennium Falcon in its second half. [Full review in Spanish]
0," Despite all that computer wizardry at work, the green-screen seams show and the herky-jerky pace mitigates against the kind of creeping tension that should inform this film."
1," Smith turns in a terrific performance, nailing Neville's angst while allowing room for humor."
0, Race attempts to tell two stories: about the life of Jesse Owens and the relationship between the US and Germany. Neither receives the attention it deserves.
0, Tumbleweeds literally blow between the laughs of this lackluster comedy.
1, Anne Fontaine has crafted a wonderfully humane film...
0, Two legends duke it out in underwhelming comedy.
0," ""Third Person"" aims to be singular, but winds up being hoist on its own conceit: Fiction may not be real, but we're still supposed to believe at least a word of it."
1," The Constant Gardener is the latest movie to try and take a grown-up look at government trickery and subterfuge, and it's the best since 2001's The Tailor of Panama."
1," Gone are the big gadgets and huge set pieces. What we get instead are some decent car chases, fist fights, and practical stunts. The result is a pretty satisfying Bond entry."
0, Boarding School often feels as if it's trying to cram too many concepts into a narrative container that is too conventional and constrictive to accommodate them all. 
1," An innocent comic exercise, fueled more on charm than titillation."
1," Most modern films noir enjoy referencing movies from the past, but the offbeat A Simple Favor works because it uses hardly any of the familiar genre tropes."
1," It's a scramble, marked by the unruly variety of visual strategies Lee prefers."
0," I'm glad I saw it, and there were some very admirable elements to the film. Yet I have to acknowledge that it could have capitalized on the good stuff a little more than it did."
0, Lucas would be proud. The rest of you should consider yourselves warned.
0, A bittersweet curtain call for the late Philip Seymour Hoffman.
1," What Gibney offers is uniquely cinematic: an emotional connection to a beguiling man, who gives you reason both to respect and revile him."
1,"Ghost Dog is... a delight for those who know his work, maybe a mystery for those who don't."
0," I enjoyed the first forty-five minutes of Beaches. Beyond that, I kept looking at my watch wondering when it was ever going to end."
1," Coogler, who grew up in the same neighborhoods as Grant, evokes a tangible sense of place, and his staging of the climactic incident hits like a fist in the gut."
1, Outstanding Mankiewicz film with the perfect cast.
1," If you can slow your personal pace down sufficiently to spend 162 minutes with these monks, your life might be changed."
1," Haynes' film has no straight lines, it is all collage and pastiche and an endless series of intersections that all, quite improbably, lead to a startlingly accurate (if abstracted) vision of the many faces of Dylan."
0, An exercise in stylish bravado that is as substantial as a catfight between supermodels.
0, ... an anachronistic and failed proposal; worse: it sounds false and feels false. [Full review in Spanish]
1,"Not all of the film's quirks are given a proper resolution, but they don't need to be. It has an honest emotional landscape, which is what ultimately matters."
1," In a wicked display of tension and percolating drama, Josie Rourke's smartly effective and intoxicating ""Mary Queen of Scots"" showcases two grandiose performances from Academy Award nominees Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie."
0," This is truly terrible: a cost-cutting British action thriller with clunky script, wooden acting, uncertain directing, cheapo-looking interiors and the most outrageously obvious and rubbish ""twist"" reveal at the end."
1, The only thing that matters in Fast & Furious 6 is that the gang takes on a tank!
0, Stephen King pits kids vs. killer clown from hell.
0, Forster and co. have produced what just might be the dullest zombie movie ever made.
1," His one real scene with Jackson is a mesmerizing corker, the two actors sparing with one another like two master chess players trying to find the most director route to their opponent's jugular."
1," Panic achieves what a plethora of gangster films never approaches: a human-scale portrayal of the psyches of the mobsters, one which demonstrates that not all mercenaries are happy with their sordid work."
1,"While it also suffers from a slow start and stretched premise, the charm of its stars getting wasted and debunking an intergalactic conspiracy goes a long way."
1,Sound City is a fun ride for diehard fans of most any brand of rock and roll.
0," Nicloux's The Nun is lovely to look at and has given Etienne a chance to shine, which she does with aplomb. Sadly, it doesn't bare too much thinking about."
0, A thriller that exasperates more than it thrills.
1," Blessedly, Were-Rabbit is as much fun to watch as it must have been to write."
1," The two leads, who like so many young Australian actors these days have made their names in American TV series, are utterly, creepily convincing..."
1," After 'Superbad' and 'Knocked Up', Judd Apatow has now pulled off the movie equivalent of the Triple Crown."
1," A fine, gritty, suspenseful, and yes, enjoyable genre piece."
0," Labor Day? That title's taken. Groundhog Day? And again. Friday The 13th? Um... hey yeah, that could work!"
1,"Complex, compassionate and endlessly illuminating..."
0," Solondz has said he wanted to play with conventions of audience identification and sympathy, but the whole gimmick is about as playful as a bucket of water poised over the theater door."
1, DiCaprio and Winslet both deliver star-making performances.
1," If, for the characters, it ends in the grey zone between victory and defeat, the film is a provocative triumph."
1," It's Scott who gives the movie its heart, delivering a performance of quiet strength and unexpected subtlety - when he's not cracking skulls."
1," This is an unambitious, old-school thriller, nothing more and nothing less."
0," Eschews any semblance of exploring an antisocial man in a heightened situation in favour of a stock-standard, twist-oriented action-thriller."
1," Narrative depth may be in short supply, but the energy, invention and humor are bracing. And let's face it: Sometimes cheese tastes good."
1,"...The Edge's fusion of Mametspeak with a true life adventure remains brawny entertainment, even it it is difficult to take as seriously as the filmmakers intend."
1," This is a smart witty film- Leary is fantastic, Spacey a blast and Davis brilliant!"
1," By showing these vastly divergent parenting styles and domestic situations, Babies can't help but ask whether Western and first-world cultures have gone too far, and become too controlling, when it comes to child rearing."
0, How much does this movie suck? Let me count the ways.
1, The best I've seen of the genre all year. [Full review in Spanish]
0," The three main female characters are little more than caricatures (sexy girlfriend, shrewish authority figure, and flouncy eye candy) who only relate to the men, and the film's final 20 seconds are undeserved at best. "
0, There just isn't any sparkle in any of the lead perfs.
0, Pure incompetence.
1," On its own staggeringly unoriginal terms, this gender-bending comedy is generally quite funny."
0," If Journey to the Center of the Earth is not a ride, then what is it? One thing it may not be, quite, is a movie."
1," ""Cafe Society"" may not be his best, but it is, at times, hilarious, and as always with Allen's films --- vastly entertaining. "
1," It's an odd piece of entertainment, and requires a viewer flexible enough to journey into the belly of the beast and somehow enjoy it. Me? I found it irresistible at times."
0," A blaring, bloated zombie of a movie."
0, Brest freights his actors with leaden pacing and a theatrical gangster-speak somewhere to the left of Damon Runyon and the right of Elmore Leonard.
1," Urban film making at its best, The Departed is a brutally violent, beautifully crafted, and incredibly well acted piece of film making that will leave you reeling. "
1," Directed by Christopher McQuarrie, ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" is the sixth film of the series, and, quite possibly, the best. Maybe only rivaled by Brad Bird's ""Ghost Protocol."" Nah, know what? I think we have a new champ. ""Fallout"" is THAT good."
0," [It] spectacularizes black criminality for white middle-class viewers, the primary audience for the festivals and art houses where this film will have its career."
1," Some viewers of Whiplash may find it morally suspect, but after a final act that grips you by the throat and doesn't let go, it's doubtful they'll mind. "
0," Sometimes a remake is just an insult - to the original, to the audience."
0," The problem with the film, which somewhat inexplicably won the Golden Bear at Berlin last year, is that it scarcely transcends the basic novelty of its premise."
0, A generic series of pep talks and rock-pumped montages. The only thing missing is a Rocky shot of the character racing up steps.
0, Fanboys is an amiable but disjointed movie that identifies too closely with its heroes. Poking a little more fun at them would have been a great idea.
0," The movie is never quite bold enough to point out the contradiction of Muslims and Christians hating one another, even though they both in theory worship the same god."
1, Parkland is history as existential despair.
1,"Fads may come and go, but dinosaurs will always be cool... a fact for which Jurassic Park should be eternally grateful."
0," [Spider Baby is] one of those lurid, macabre, amusingly exaggerated B-horror movies beloved by the psychotronic/Joe Bob Briggs crowds."
0," Where did the great hero go, the one from Sean Connery in Goldfinger to Daniel Craig himself in Casino Royale, the elegant killer spy who spews memorable lines, his world-traveling adventures engorged with intrigue and mysterious women?"
1, Dafoe is inspired in the kind of performance that makes an actor being cast as a famous figure seem inevitable in hindsight.
1,"In its best moments, the film deploys an inventive range of flashbacks to the first film to show the extent to which nostalgia exerts its grip."
0,"The movie never quite shakes off a glib, incurious outsider's perspective that can tilt into outright cluelessness, particularly where some of its more egregious casting choices are concerned."
1," Graduation opens with a brick thrown through an apartment window, and unfolds with that same kind of propulsive force."
0," What the protagonists do is simply wrong, and their attempts to fix it are first tepid, then unpleasant."
0," Let's get one thing straight. It's not drivel because of its lesbian titillation. It's just drivel. The Beavis and Butthead mentality is just another reason to loathe it, like Page Three of The Sun."
0,"Watching The Ring won't kill you, but it could bore you half to death."
0," Relying in no small part on Smith's reliably first-rate performance, Concussion is a thoughtful and interesting story neglectfully executed."
1, ...constructed largely of close-ups and was filmed on a single concrete set representing the prison where Joan of Arc was imprisoned ...
1," Steers, in his feature film debut, has created a brilliant motion picture."
0," A cute, glamorous and 'qwerky' French fancy that features a delightful performance from Deborah Francois, but it's overshadowed by a Gallic inferiority complex."
0," There was always the chance of Snowden's story coming off as an underpowered Bourne movie, but Stone somehow finds ways to make it extra boring."
0," All the characters get in fights but, SPOILER ALERT, everything ends with hugs, violins, good wishes and warm hearts."
0," Just as bad as most of what Cage has been doing lately, but doesn't offer any of the campy delight of ""The Wicker Man"" or ""Drive Angry."" "
1," If you remember M. Night's work prior to The Happening and wished for a return to the kind of cerebral thrillers that the world was introduced to through his efforts, you're in for a treat."
0,"The film is so truncated, so obsessed with style and composed of so many self-contained episodes that it fails to say anything new."
1, The film's principal characters descend into the nightmare made real that compelling storytellers Stratton and Zola build around them.
1," To expose hidden truths, Haneke's camera intimately informs the viewer as to character motivations. With cinematographer Christian Berger, experience and patience makes use of digital technology less a gimmick and more of a key narrative device."
0," Reenactment of 1980 embassy takeover has blood, violence. "
1," I was already getting excited for my second viewing ten minutes into my first ... it's got the weird vernacular, the Australian-ness .... It may have cost hundreds of millions of dollars, but still feels home-grown, hand-made, and completely deviant."
1," ""Inside Out"" is about the passing of childhood ritual, its most bittersweet moments the ones glimpsed in a rear-view mirror, as it reminds the unfaithful: Remember when you loved that? When you lived for this? Until you didn't anymore?"
1," Most of all, Nightcrawler is a fine thriller and a great showcase for [Jake] Gyllenhaal's talent, wit, and comic timing."
0, Enervated and uselessly ugly.
1," While each entry satisfies in its own unique way, the anthology as a whole makes for an impressive examination of distaff fears and underestimated ferocity."
0, That they should learn Greek dancing from a Mexican-born actor in a film produced by 20th Century Fox is somehow less ironic than just about right for a movie like this.
0,Lee has gone for shaggy comedy. Some of it is funny. Some of it just sits there.
0," There's very little about hiking in this movie, but you do get to see Nick Nolte stuffing pancakes into his stupid face. "
1," ""A deviation from the Marvel formula, a gloriously, defiant weird movie that nevertheless proves to be an enormous crowd-pleaser."""
1, Oooh la la and a certain je ne sais quoi permeate every frame of this imaginative French gem that leaves ordinary animated projects in the dust.
1," It is charming and often seems to have some real insight to this arrested adolescence that seems to be more and more common, if not acceptable these days."
1,"One of the greatest horror films made. The opening sequence is not only a classic, it's still frightening nearly three decades after it was made."
0," ... I suspect for anyone who was not enchanted by the novel, it is a tale that remains unsatisfying and empty ..."
0," Cooper seems at once fired up by the meet-cute potential of the premise, which he nails, and stuck at a creative crossroads with the more melancholy, sepia-toned stuff that probably first drew the previously-attached Clint Eastwood's attention."
1," Although its message is never subtle, Delhi Safari is fun enough to earn the right to preach."
1," A typical, gory ghost story done with a lot of very skillful atmosphere. One of the movies that made John Carpenter a name."
0," Laggies soon goes off the rails, its plot becoming more contrived and characters increasingly erratic."
1," Expertly balancing his performance between quiet regret, self-destructive arrogance and howling stubbornness, Fiennes takes center stage without making the role a vanity project."
0, About a dozen other movies have used variations on this plot. And every single one of them has been smarter and more entertaining than Over Her Dead Body.
1, This micro-budget suspense film generates more actual tension than nine out of 10 Hollywood thrillers.
1,"Extraordinarily evolved documentary, proving it's ethically and emotionally devastating to monkey with nature."
1," A very well-made, funny and entertaining picture."
0,"Though less apocalyptical than usual, the imagery is as lavish as ever, but the film is wrecked by an underwritten narrative."
1," Whatever your views on the US in general and Harding in particular, you'll leave this cheering for Margot Robbie. Bravo!"
0," If you like movies that are bad but occasionally amusing in their ridiculousness, you might get something out of it. Otherwise, there's nothing to enjoy here. "
0," Pride and Glory, directed by Gavin O'Connor, plods across familiar ground. It's yet another movie about the fraternal disorder of the police."
1," When a situation becomes intriguing, writer-director Curtis develops ADD and shifts focus. Fortunately, the cast and Curtis' eye for absurdly comic situations wins out. "
0," The fusion of effects-fueled action fantasy with comedy worked well for director Ivan Reitman 22 years ago in Ghostbusters and, less so, five years ago in Evolution. But, it fails to save his latest, My Super Ex-Girlfriend."
0,"Uncomplicated but unremarkable, Jane won't blow anyone away."
1,"As sequels go, this is passable: no more coherent than the episodic first instalment, but with enough sick humour to satisfy the mildly depraved."
1, Director Matthew Vaughn has shaken the cobwebs off the franchise and confidently delivered this prequel as a first class blockbuster.
1," It's unlike any other animated feature -- excepting, of course, Miyazaki's own."
0," It's all crazy enough to work for a while, but the 124 long minutes don't pass soon enough."
1,Edgar Wright/Simon Pegg/Nick Frost have become a comedy brand to rival Richard Curtis/Hugh Grant. They've done it by making comedies with real laughs.
1, Stunning psychological exposé by strong first-time director Taylor-Wood who understands the emotional stain that haunted John Lennon. 
1, Demoustier and Duris give real heart to characters whose behaviour could easily have seemed absurd.
1, The Others stands apart merely for recognizing that animatronic gargoyles are no substitute for unhinged neuroses.
1," Played by Letitia Wright, Shuri is a revelation. Wright steals every scene with her bright smile and perfect comedic timing. "
0, Overproduced action movies aimed at the lowest common denominator simply cannot get any more trite or insultingly hackneyed than Kiss of the Dragon.
0," More hoot than hot, this elaborately produced, over-the-top Chinese oddity promoted as the first 3D erotic movie is a genre and naked-body mash-up that will arouse a varied menu of responses..."
0, Jingoistic enough to make the members of Team America stumble towards the woodchipper in disbelief.
1," Hailee Steinfeld lifts this likeable offering from first-time writer-director Kelly Fremon Craig towards the higher slopes of the high-school, rite-of-passage genre pile."
0," An ignorant, false, bigoted, boring, pretentious film that could have been made by Eisenstein in the Kremlin under Joseph Stalin in 1938."
0," As a study of human nature under pressure, focusing on the crimes we commit as well as the bonds of solidarity we forge, it's unremittingly dour."
1," My heart was warmed by gratuitous moments when Mr. Carrey clowns for clowning's sake -- in the best of them, he makes a slo-mo entrance to a press conference, even though the camera is running at normal speed."
0," It is good-natured, lowbrow, backlot, hit-or-miss humor, but with no cumulative effect beyond its succession of hard-worked jokes."
0, An uneasy blend of the naughty and the nice in which the two ingredients fail to mesh....The result isn't bad; it's just not good enough.
0, It has no substance; it doesn't say anything.
0," A salt-of-the-earth tale that'll play well in red states, but offers little spark."
1," Unbreakable shows us lightning can strike twice in the same place, if you make it, but the second time will never be quite as thrilling."
0," This embarrassing sequel to the 2001 remake of the old Rat Pack romp is bogus on a biblical scale -- a bunch of smug movie stars, goofing on their images, wandering through the wilderness for 40 years. Or what seems like it."
0," What big eyes you have, Amanda. And what trouble you seem to have finding a movie that can put them to good use."
0," Keeps people and things moving fast enough so that you don't have time to worry about the details, like the inanity of the story."
0," The movie is the cinematic equivalent of junk food. It satisfies the craving for the sensation of nihilism, without its substance."
0, Real joys and sorrows must be bigger and deeper than this.
1," [Director] Levin skillfully mixes the Barnes interviews with news clippings, 1970s street scenes and the recollections of Mr. Untouchable's former associates."
1," In the seconds and minutes around the taking of a photograph, Kiarostami reminds us, the world changes, but mostly in increments."
0," It moves along at a speedy clip, though it substitutes sadism for such niceties as wit and style."
0," Unfortunately, Provost mostly avoids Leduc's substantial literary contribution in favor of depicting her life solely through her friends and mentors, and her mother Berthe with whom she had a dysfunctional relationship."
0," Not one of Fogelman's good scripts. Like The Guilt Trip, that relied on the casting of Seth Rogan & Barbra Streisand, this flimsy premise of four 60 something guys heading to Vegas for a last hurrah is counting on star power with little else to offer"
1," Not only surpasses its original but also brings with it the undeniable sense that yes, finally, all the maddening chaos and underlying pathos of this deeply political story has finally revealed an important subtext."
0, There are moments of real pleasure to be found in Sara Sugarman's whimsical comedy Very Annie-Mary but not enough to sustain the film.
0, I still can't think of a reason why this couldn't have been set in the present.
0, Ee're all supposed to forgive his numerous faults when we see the sparkle in his eye and how much he really does love his daughter.
1," Chastain is so good at the steely-eye determinism of Sloane, in the believability of what she does, and in making us understand why she does it, that the character is likable and even relatable despite her repugnant win-at-all-cost methods."
1, Destined to become definitive holiday entertainment for all the family.
0," Despite the best efforts of an impressive cast, Taymor's adaptation ends up a curious mix of arse-achingly dull, and clangingly misjudged."
0," This film had the potential to be much more heartfelt, but the silly antics in the beginning, and the cool approach of the parents towards their ""ugly daughter"" undermine the poignancy that the filmmakers were obviously shooting for in the end."
0," Even in the midst of a contentious election year, both ends of the political spectrum can agree that The Campaign misses the mark."
1," A handsomely-made, brightly charming pleasure."
1," Hey, he SAID he'd be baaahck."
1,"This is a story about the most immutable force in nature and all the delirious highs and lows it imparts. Carol argues that yes, love hurts. But man, does it feel good."
1, Might sweet-natured and pleasantly naughty British comedy be in the offing? You bet.
1," KUBO is not only possibly the best animated film of the year, it will likely be one of the best films of 2016."
1," There are serious lessons in Ó Domhnaill's film for Irish government policy, if it is not too late to reverse the sins of the past."
1," Fascinating documentary about Belgrade-born performance artist Marina Abramovic, her life and controversial performance pieces will engage even the most skeptical among us and trigger unexpected musings about some heavy subjects."
0," There's a tyranny in McQueen's vision as he compels hero Solomon Northup on a vile trajectory of kidnap, brutality and dehumanisation."
0," If you want somebody to save the neighborhood, or to blow up the planet, Jamie Lee Curtis is the one. She has the smile, the moves, the haircut, and the chops. Now all she needs is the directors to match."
1," While so many ostensibly serious films explore murky moral ambiguity, Tarantino knows that it can be cathartic to see unalloyed villains, whether Nazis or slave owners, get their comeuppance."
0," For those of you who seek cerebral wit, don't break any previous engagements to attend."
1," While Anvil! is frequently funny, it'd be a mistake to call the band a joke."
1, The enormous behind-the-camera crew makes it a rich looking film that is easy to watch. Too bad the routine story brings it down a notch.
1, ...good fare for discerning audiences seeking a mature and entertaining film.
0," Proving definitively that slapping Mr. Franco's scenery-eating grin on any old drivel doesn't guarantee entertainment, ""Why Him?"" is trite, crass and insultingly moronic."
1, The original queer tragicomedy
0," The Golden Circle is two hours and 21 minutes long, and at least half of that feels like clutter. "
1," A rich, inspiring, and at times infuriating evocation of Daje's inner life."
0," Silence is Martin Scorsese's film about Jesuit priests in 17th-century Japan whose faith is sorely tested, just as your patience will be sorely tested too."
1," Although not as witty in plot design as debut director Giuseppe Capotondi imagines, ""The Double Hour"" is an atmospheric suspense thriller that succeeds on the strength of its two leading actors. "
0, The various symbols never coalesce into metaphor so much as they stand stagnant and hollow at the edges of the frame.
1," Klein creates a mood of tension, foreboding and sombre reflection through occasional moments of slo-mo and camera work that blurs reality. His literate script offers no easy resolution, only the faint hope that love can rescue two lost souls."
0," One only has to think of Battlefield Earth and After Earth to realise that putting the name of our planet into a movie title isn't always a good idea. Happily, Escape From Planet Earth is a reasonable exception."
0," Louder, dumber and even more cartoonish than the original-which is saying a lot-and you come out of it feeling as though you'd been trapped inside an explosion for a couple of hours. "
1,"A fantastic manipulation, taking viewers to a tranquil place of immense culture and beauty while studying the enticing ease of nostalgia. And here's something I never thought I'd write again: Owen Wilson is marvelous here."
1," Though it's a bit short on context and detail, the movie boasts a host of riveting interviews with the men caught behind enemy lines in the brutal winter battle at North Korea's Chosin Reservoir."
1," Fassbender makes a cool gunfighter/anti-hero, and New Zealand does a nice job doubling for America's Old West in this offbeat fable"
0," God's Pocket has all the ingredients of a mischievous black comedy, but is neither sly nor merciless enough to embrace the absurdity of its tragedy."
1," With its social commentary, multiple character narrative, and thriller framework, Virzi's film will appeal to local audiences who embraced Lantana, arguably Australia's last modern classic."
0," ""In combat, confusion is normal,"" an Army manual helpfully pointed out in World War II. That same confusion seems to have infected A Midnight Clear."
0,"Even Michael Caine's career would have gone nowhere if he had made this version of ""Alfie."
1," The Islands And The Whales knows when to be small, and its intimate portraits of day to day life illustrate how the monumental intersects with the personal."
1,The best thing you can say about The Infiltrator is that Cranston and company are entirely persuasive in a film that doesn't make the best use of their stellar efforts.
0,Ewan McGregor's directorial debut doesn't do justice to Philip Roth's great book.
0," Without major tension, conflict or crisis, Brawne and Keats simply mope about, moon at each other, talk about literature and wait for the great poet to die from tuberculosis."
0, There's a lot of running around but not much fun in this strained remake.
1," If you are looking for an agreeable and entertaining school holidays film for younger children, this is it. Fans of the comic strip should get a kick out of it, too."
1," Fans of the surprise 2012 hit Ted will find plenty to love in this sequel, in which Seth Macfarlane takes the same approach: throwing every kind of gag at the screen in the hopes that some of them stick."
1, This entertaining film offers fizzy family fun with a catchy musical number every few minutes and a strong cast that makes the most of their tailor-made characters.
1," Certain movies are shameful for snubbing the laws of reality, but Being John Malkovich does not once feel sidetracked by the zany twists."
0," At its worst, ""The Ridiculous 6"" plays the Donald Trump card of sneering at political correctness in one scene, and then make amends for being a jerk in the next."
0, There isn't a genuinely frightening or interesting moment here.
0, Works a little better than the first Power Rangers movie but will not extend its appeal beyond the show's fan base.
0, There is some satisfaction to be had in a step-by-step mystery being competently executed -- but such plots are so cheap that they've mostly been demoted from the big screen to episodic television.
1," It might sound damning to say that the film resembles a bullet-riddled carcass just barely clinging to life, but it's exactly this ephemeral sensation, which Mann sustains for the entire two hours plus, that distinguishes Public Enemies."
1," A story with great potential, it could have been better. But watch it anyway because its simplicity is beautiful."
0," Has the unlikely distinction of rendering Witherspoon shrill, dull, and during one ugly drunken tirade, irredeemable."
1, Writer-director Sean Durkin's psychological thriller is first woozily unsettling and then coolly shocking. Olsen and Hawkes are remarkable.
0," Elegantly shot but poorly assembled, Campion's fractured film [has] . . . a lot of vivid blood and guts, but no head and brains to control the flow of passion."
0," Drenched in emotion and suffused with good intentions, Body of War is impossible not to like, but difficult to admire."
0," What Hannibal Rising is, mostly, is a hoot. Gong Li cautions the nightmare-plagued Hannibal that 'Memory is a knife -- it can hurt you.' And let's not forget the classic, 'They ate my sister.'"
0," We're told that characters are drawing closer to each other or changing their lives for the better, but we don't often feel it."
1," Moonrise Kingdom is a delight... stuffed full of the quirky details and gags that are Anderson's trademarks, but it also possesses an emotional undertow that will tug at those viewers in tune with its singular sensibility."
0,"I like the actors, but the movie did them no justice."
1," I give To Die For a thumbs up for Kidman's performance, for interesting docudrama style cinematography, and for some huge laughs."
1," A lot of reviewers seem to have disliked Street Kings because of its negative view of the LA police, and perhaps the country at large. That is not a problem for me."
0, Wolverine doesn't rise above the level of familiar competence.
0, Chris Columbus has pasted the grungy La Boheme update onto film with slavish respect for the original material but a shortage of stylistic imagination and raw emotions.
1," The relationship between Griet and Vermeer plays out almost like a dance. The whole movie plays like that, a romance and a history told in waltz time."
1," This is a white-knuckle ride, with a twisting script to match."
0," Once you are accustomed to the manners and methodology of the film, what remains is the story. And in this one, it's thin gruel"
1," McQueen has used this near-documentary style of filming before, but this is the first time it's seemed essential to his story."
0," Steve Martin, Jack Black and Owen Wilson all have made a great film or two, surrounded by tons of bad ones. ""The Big Year"" is closer to the latter."
0," Glum, degrading and dull exploitation film featuring Jim Carrey as ""the last honest cop in Poland."" "
1, Inside Llewyn Davis is a quiet triumph of a film.
1, Elevated considerably by fine lead performances from Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson.
0, The film has a very good cast and it is an interesting story but it does have an odd pace.
0,"The contrivances pile up more quickly than snowfall in a Buffalo winter, and the ending is so lame that it provoked guffaws from theater-goers attending the screening along with me."
1," At a narrative and stylistic level, is one of the most complete works that we have been able to witness in the last century. [Full review in Spanish]"
1," This is a true adaptation, giving the impression of filming the whole book while carefully choosing what to include and leave out -- and thus it feels more complete and satisfying."
0," It's hard to miss the irony of Jackie counseling her son over how story endings should feel ""surprising but inevitable"" in a movie that's all inevitability and no surprise. "
1," I would have liked a few more scenes with the underused Kate Winsleet than some of the unnecessarily long training sequences but ""Divergent"" was still a pleasant surprise; utilizing a likable female heroine."
0, This keeda could've had a much sharper bite.
1," Sprawling, and hugely ambitious, and containing a glorious Wellesian Falstaff who's as majestic in folly as he is in girth."
1,"Pardon the cliche, but it really is that rare film that will appeal to all ages."
1," Director Peter Sollett painted a different side of New York in his debut feature Raising Victor Vargas, but here successfully mixes genres and earns genuine laughs."
1," Any film that boasts two jokes about Roland Barthes and one scene - surreal, deadpan, inspired - of superannuated cross-dressing will take its place, for some, near the front of the must-see queue."
1," If I'm not dreaming, I've just seen one of the boldest mainstream American movies in ages."
0," It's all like first-draft Mamet, or Tarantino in a pissy, self-sabotaging mood: neither clever nor funny, but convinced it's both."
0,[Contains] tin-earned dialogue and haphazard plotting ...
0, A few adjectives shy of great and powerful.
0, This insultingly dumb film doesn't even have the good manners to be fun.
1, It gets by on personality.
1," Zack and Miri Make a Porno, in spite of its lewdness, follows a gee-whiz romantic-comedy formula that would not be out of place on the Disney Channel."
1," Let Me In is not as fantastic as Let the Right One In, which you should rent immediately. But it is undeniably powerful and made with obvious admiration and respect for the source material."
0," A movie that, in the end, is no smarter than any other run-of-the-mill cinematic death fest, just grimmer, bleaker and sadder."
0, [T]he basic skeleton of the story is at obvious odds with itself and not all of the charismatic actors in the world will keep the outcome from feeling like it lasts forever.
1, There is new hope that the guy originally chosen to close this series has reinvigorated a reboot that could be destined for its own trilogy.
0," There will be worse movies this summer than The Village, but few ultimately as silly."
1, There's something bracing about the difficulty of reconciling this earnest middle-aged hippie with his maniacally impish younger self.
1," Keeping in mind that the film is based on comic book characters, the overall result is better than most ..."
0, ...the trite film fails to deliver the necessary thrills and chills it so desperately wants us to experience. 
0, It's worth knowing how to pronounce Gigli because it will enter the vocabulary as a word meaning 'massive box-office flop; an embarrassment caused by Hollywood's inability to say no to powerful creative types. See also: Ishtar.'
0," Fifty Shades Darker takes the Dark Knight approach to franchise maintenance, taking pains to assure you that its protagonists are serious about their passions. "
1, A particularly intense and unsettling watch.
1, Less than impressive film.
0, Parental Content Review
0, The picture can't quite pull off its ambitious challenge. There's a reason nobody has tried this before.
1," A rare example of what can happen when a director, writer, cast, composer, and subject matter all work together perfectly."
0, The Female Brain never seems quite sure whether it wants to probe the depths of its title subject or just make us laugh. 
0," A terrible movie, sappy and dead in the water."
1,"McDonagh encompasses equal parts of engagement, humor, and enlightenment. It's the gold standard of a terrific script paired with even better storytelling. "
1," In his first film as director, Noam Murro creates moments of comic disconnection, relieved by minuscule surges of warmth. He's very precise; he has a nice touch."
0," Despite Robin Hood boasting a talented cast, the cheesiness of their script would blunt the sharpest of performances. "
0," Curse of the Golden Flower is a triumph of set dressing, cinematography and costuming. Now if only it were compelling."
1, A brilliant coup sees the film kick off with an extended flashback to Indiana's early days and our young hero (Phoenix) having his first taste of adventure during a scout trip in Utah.
1," Rarely does a film defy both expectation and convention to such powerful, borderline-poetic effect."
0," Let's Be Cops is good for some chuckles and a couple of big laughs, but won't keep you rolling in the aisles throughout."
1, The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part might not be as awesome as its forerunner but that doesn't make it any less worthwhile.
0, Contains some eye-catching moments but the combination of languorous pacing and laboured line delivery means that it is is likely to play best on the festival circuit.
0," Tamasha may have its heart in the right place, but the conflict in Ved and Tara's lives will not get your pulse racing."
1," [A] beautiful, complex, massively layered adaptation of the Alberto Moravia novel."
0, The movie works when Carrey's mugging it up ... but melts into a saccharine tub of goo when he plays it straight.
1,"What we're left with is a touching love story, an outsized spectacle and a glorious bit of color in an often all too drab world."
0," If Old Dogs isn't the absolute worst movie either star has appeared in, it's close enough to count."
1, Fair enough rendering of a fanciful event.
1," A droll and frantic melodrama stripped of aesthetic contrivances but full of emotional ones, and it is affirming in its own way without being particularly cathartic."
0," Once we know what the couple's big mystery is, ""By the Sea"" doesn't make sense and begins to seem the one thing it hasn't all along - silly."
0, It's always a bad sign when the core audience of a film -- children -- are either walking out early or are half-asleep when the credits roll at the end of a film.
1," First Blood is first and foremost and oft-overlooked war classic, spinning the focus and looking at the very real and painful fallout for those involved in such traumatic events. "
1," The title implies a different tack and a different take - both of which pay off ... if you're new to the hunt, see Going Clear first, then feast on this as a bitterly tasty dessert."
1, A technically expert and visually seductive tour de force from someone who is very likely the funniest man in Asia.
1, It's tough-minded and anything but happy.
1," This shaggy, likeable film from director Fernando León de Aranoa chronicles 24 obstacle-ridden hours in the life of some international aid workers."
0," In the end, I think this film would've worked better with B-list actors and a director who fully embraced the melodrama. As it is, The Light Between Oceans feels like a film between genres."
1," It may not have the visual panache of the first two films, but it makes up for it with a thrilling series of events that set us up nicely for the final film in the franchise."
0," At its best, the film is very funny. At its worst, it makes you groan in dismay."
1,"Amiable, kid-oriented slapstick..."
1," ""Nut up or shut up,"" is the most quotable of Woody Harrelson's cowboy maxims in the genre mash-up Zombieland, and squeamish moviegoers should take it as gospel."
1, Wilder's direction is crisp and the lighting and cinematography (by John F. Seitz) have become iconic touchstones.
1," Not only doesn't Machete have good taste, it has never *heard* of good taste."
0," And yet, you wish there was more nastiness, a satirical bite that is clearly missing in the pages of the script. The issues at hand are, more often than not, used as a backdrop for romcom conventions rather than the other way around. "
1, Christopher McQuarrie has brought together a great cast and crew to bring his screenplay to life.
0," This is one of those rare films that truly manages to get by on unintentional laughs, but otherwise dreadful."
0,"Despite its generally genial, boys-will-be-boys air, there are a few scenes and storylines that lodge in the mind unpleasantly."
1, It is not to be missed.
0, Tumbleweeds literally blow between the laughs of this lackluster comedy.
0," A huge misstep for co-writer and director Lauren Miller Rogen, who probably made this lazy vanity project so the cast and crew could get a free Caribbean vacation."
1," Cooper gives his heroes highly personal issues: his sanity and his music for Jack, and her sense of self-worth for Ally."
0," Each film throws two or three okay action scenes into an otherwise wobbly blend of macho posturing, philosophically windy chitchat and moldy archetypes."
1,"Lively, richly animated with intriguing motion capture fluidity, and pleasingly designed with special attention to sprawling Martian environments, the feature is nearly sunk by the efforts of co-star Dan Fogler."
1," It looks and feels very familiar, but being such a lean, mean tightly-woven thriller also makes it a refreshing break from the contemporary norm."
0, The movie devolves into an egregious Three Stooges painfest: We're meant to giggle and clap along with Kevin as the crooks get their heads singed with blowtorches and walk barefoot on glass.
1,"This is the action movie of the year, maybe the best in several years. It is trying to be the next Bond-type franchise series and if the next one is anywhere near this good, it may succeed."
0, There are enough laughs in it if you're willing to settle.
1," Much of the poop humor is surprisingly fresh and funny, as in the scene where only a shower curtain separates an enormous man bent on relieving himself and the hidden, breath-holding boy he's been chasing. You know, if you go for that sort of thing."
0," This is not a seamlessly constructed movie, but as long as you're not expecting great art, it's unlikely to disappoint."
1," It is intense and uneven, moving and maddening, all in just about equal measure. But an angry Lee is an interesting Lee, and he's really angry here."
1," Slow-paced and thought-provoking, veering from boring, to overbearing, to fascinating and back again..."
0," Without ideologies at play, how is this ""Purge"" film different from the others? It isn't. It's interesting, then boring, then bad, like the rest."
1," Events move at a fast clip, the paleontology talk is kept to a minimum, the computer-generated effects are beautifully realised, and the characters perform their parts with the required efficiency."
1, Visually expansive and imaginative.
1," Nail-bitingly intense, thanks to some powerful performances and Tobias Lindholm's strong direction and fantastic script."
0," Lit like a David Fincher music video and shot with a gliding camera approximating a wandering eye, Stravinsky strains to convince that its lascivious pleasures have historical import."
1, Better to fixate on the interstellar eye candy.
1," Positively dripping with a soggy, oppressive atmosphere, the film is blanketed with a miasma of madness."
0," It would benefit from more of a structural spine, and the characters need more definition (including fleshed-out backstory) to avoid feeling like an evocative, elliptical short story simply stretched to fit a longer frame."
0, It's like watching the dreckiest of teen puppy courtships trying to pass itself off as 'Annie Hall.
1," ""Disorder"" is Alice Winocour challenging our precepts of masculinity and Schoenaerts putting his masculine form through an evocative, psychosexual rigor."
0, There's a dizziness to Sheridan's cinematic storytelling here that at times makes the film hard to follow.
0, The film is at its worst when trying to outright engage you and at its best when it doesn't pay the audience much mind.
0, ...soulless factory-line junk...
1," An absolutely brilliant, 3-hour examination of detached, dysfunctional behavior in modern America. Easily one of Altman's best films."
0," It's as stodgy as it is inert, the film about as invigorating and thought-provoking as watching an episode of Gilligan's Island after drinking one too many Mojitos."
1," With its nice combination of raunchy teen comedy and buddy cop bromance, 21 Jump Street successfully creates its own identity with no intention on copying the dynamic of the hit TV show that inspired it."
0,"Jarmusch missed his mark; trying to present simple, non-dramatic moments but using celebrities"
0," A stoopid movie, front-loaded with infantile shtick."
0," Instead of embracing its two-dimensional farcicality, the movie tries to pass off its stock characters as real people -- and it doesn't work."
1," The charm of Fighting With My Family is irresistible. Uplifting and hilarious, embodying the tropes and delights of the underdog genre with a shameless smile."
1," Whale Rider is, in a word: Nourishment."
1," Coming after Michael Bay's terrifyingly psychotic Transformers sequel, it's a relief to have a lowbrow fantasy actioner that's lively and busy without being crushingly relentless."
1," A treat for Hitchcock fans and cineastes, this is absolutely a primer for any and all budding filmmakers and should send people rushing out to get a book that's still in print and still arguably the most indispensible tome on movies ever written."
1,"To absorb the extraordinary details, colors, shapes and situations that are rife with layered danger is to witness this director's fierce commitment to his own vision."
0," A series of self-consciously ""awesome"" moments that don't add up to anything."
0," A PG-13 sitcom rom-com that desperately wants to be a Judd Apatow movie when it grows up, Tom Vaughan's flat film mixes screwball comedy with self-help clichés to tired effect."
0, There seems little rationale for Omen '06 except to resuscitate a brand name that carried enough pop-culture clout in Watergate's aftermath to inspire a host of gnarly sequels.
0," In spite of excellent performances by the three main cast members -- Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte and Daniel Grao -- you may find your mind wandering."
1," A smart, harrowing and mordant drama set inside a fictional Wall Street firm at the trip-wire moment just before the 2008 financial collapse."
1," ""Darkest Hour"" is a persuasive window into history, and so arresting in its portrait of one of the 20th century's most important leaders that every minute of it is absorbing."
1, Prometheus stirs the suspicion that the creators are no wiser than the audience about what all the scattergun clues and symbols actually add up to.
0," Though there are funny one-liners early on, the script becomes increasingly lazy, while the violence which takes over the second half feels as if it belongs to a different picture."
0, Its breathlessness and permanent state of confusion make you long for the assured touch of M. Night Shyamalan.
0," Fairy tales either elate or depress, for Winter's Tale, it mostly sedates. "
0," Anything that can go wrong, will - often in spectacular fashion."
0," Lesson-laden, tear-jerking fairy tale."
1,"As the movie travels from New York to Idaho to India, nimbly slinging itself over gaps in likelihood and logic, it works its own sort of magic."
1," What makes Interstellar one of the best, most enthralling, intelligent and moving science-fiction films of modern cinema is not so much the inter-galactic journey it takes you on as the emotional journey."
1, Manages to make currency crashes and the Asian Financial Crisis a juicy subject onscreen.
1," What makes The Second Mother particularly compelling is that the Muylaert doesn't particularly judge or take sides with her characters, even as she criticizes the social construct within which she places them."
0, McKinnon's too-muchness is the only thing The Spy Who Dumped Me has going for it.
0," A very unappealing animated feature about Babe Ruth, baseball, and family values."
1," Ida is barely 80 minutes and lacks fullness, and the style that's so arresting can also seem studied. But the movie's chill is hard to shake off."
1, This is scary but great
1, The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
1," The film reminds us not only of the many uses of enchantment, but of the exhilarating magic of the words, 'Let's pretend.'"
0, Just because virtually any story can be told through the eyes of a solipsistic teen girl doesn't mean that it should be.
1," Stand Clear Of The Closing Doors stubbornly resists a sense of intimacy, the film determined to express how communication can always be inclusive, even in whispers."
0," Sickly sweet and tough to swallow, romantic comedy Home Again is a jagged little pill of contrivance and cliché that entirely wastes the talents of lead actress Reese Witherspoon."
0,"A self-indulgent trip for Smith; pity, there's a fun movie in there dying to come out."
1," Though it runs a longish 110 minutes, for the majority of the time, it's a smart, jam-packed movie with plenty to enjoy."
0," Entire sub-plots and characters could have been sacrificed and still this good-natured, perma-cranked-up-to-11 rom-com would have been too noisy for some."
0, ... the ordeal is excruciating -- for the audience and for the victims...
0," It makes you want to revisit Goodfellas, though."
0, Critics are foolish to believe they have the critical tools to make meaningful judgments about a movie as confounding as Bright. They just don't. I don't. We have to admit this fact and surrender to Bright.
0," David Lynch has been working on his latest film, Inland Empire for years, and it feels like he has included every minute of the footage he shot."
1," Lightweight, fitfully amusing and predictable goof on Southern white manhood, hunting and fathers and sons. "
1," Matthew McConaughey should always play lawyers. There's something smirky, cocky and untrustworthy about his demeanor -- he slides through every movie like a greased weasel, but in The Lincoln Lawyer, it works."
1, Ms. Stewart's portrayal has the ring of truth and the urgency of terror. Maureen is a woman besieged by invisible forces.
1, It's a true original.
1, a soaring vision that appeals to the senses and the spirit
1, Johnny Depp takes a big chance in an over the top performance that could just as easily have turned into a bad joke as a larger than life character.
1,"It's about as close to French farce as romantic comedies get, and the closer the better."
0, Diálogos sem graça em um filme sem ritmo. Um dos mais fracos do diretor.
1," The Nice Guys is like James Ellroy by way of Abbott & Costello. Frequently hilarious, often surprising, and consistently fun."
0," It's not a very good movie, but you can't have Ferrell without getting a few good laughs here and there."
0," Not that Moland is after a realistic, philosophical interrogation of cold-blooded revenge anyway -- and given Neeson's own recent, deeply unfortunate racist remarks, that may be for the best."
0," Just when we think we 'get' where Cody and Kusama are taking us, they thwart expectations and cinematic standards%u2026but not always in a good way."
0," Andrew Jenkins' amateurish, half-hearted romantic comedy-cum-heist film twists itself into unconvincing knots to pull off a guilt-free bank robbery."
0," Wait for video and borrow your neighbor's tape. If, after five minutes, you've already reached sugar overload, you won't have wasted anything."
0," The dialogue is wiseass yet witless, the action incessant minus any novelty of style, stunts, or ideas."
1," Channeling the spirit of the Russians (Eisenstein, Dovshenko, Vertov), the director uses grotesque angles, close-ups, and rhythms to suggest a powerful sense of seduction and torture."
1, A thriller whose intensity is driven by emotion as much as it is by motion.
0," It's a film where there's almost no plot and what plot there is is totally predictable. So it's just a series of gun battles and, after five minutes or so, you get heartily sick of it. "
0," Those who step up to the box office window and request ""Doom"" will get what they asked for."
0," To his credit, director Antoine Fuqua makes this nonsense as effective as possible. In the end, however, his efforts are undone by the button-pushing script."
0," The new Rollerball is not so much a remake of Norman Jewison's 1975 socio-political sports thriller but a complete massacre of the idea, which wasn't that good to begin with."
1," What distinguishes the film is its oft-forlorn, last-day-of-summer-camp quality."
0," A shambles of a movie--visually unattractive, unbearably loud and utterly silly...its hilarity is completely unintentional."
1," The Desolation of Smaug is a lot of fun, but for the love of God, just end it already."
1,"The humor is fast and furious, especially the ingrained hatred between fans of ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek."
0, Like grafting the conflict-free pizzazz of Ocean's Thirteen onto Lions for Lambs.
0, A jet-setting game of cat and mouse that suits naptime more than movie time.
0, I am not advocating for Rand's political point of view. It is worth a discussion. Only it deserves a better discussion than is given in Atlas Shrugged: Part 1.
1," This is a terrific little picture, one that checks all the traditional rom-com boxes."
1,"This is a sweet, funny, unapologetically sentimental film."
0, An occasionally entertaining misfire that only scratches the surface of what a Venom movie could truly be.
1," the movie is little more than an interracial riff on Meet the Parents, but it's consistently funny, and it's enough of a riff to make it feel fresh."
0, One dull and anonymous movie...less like 'Midnight Run' or '48 Hrs.' than 'Pure Luck.'
1, A well-acted entertainment that's highly respectful of the story it has to tell. It's disjointed but fun to watch.
1," War really is hell, and Fury shows how."
0, Manipulative rather than inspirational and hackneyed rather than original.
0," I was not prepared for the tedious artistic choices, which made the movie glum and dreary for me."
0," A sometimes entertaining film, it just never gels."
0," A deep plunge into the mind of a troubled man, Nightingale may be too sad and disturbing for the average viewer, but a strong performance by David Oyewolo and some clever storytelling techniques hold and reward our attention."
0, The truth is that Life is an Alien knock-off and a carbon copy of every retro sci-fi film ever made about the dangers of life in space. 
1, An imaginative documentary on two Argentinian dancers with a passion for this dance form.
0," ""Slippery"" is the word used in the festival synopsis, but I would rather use the term ""haphazard,"" as it seems more fitting to describe the film's careless political compass."
1,Polymorphously perverse 'Skin' nearly flawless.
0," I spent the hours ... counting the times Jolie's dialogue seemed to arrive in the form of a capsule review. ""Am I really this dull?"" ""Dear Lord, that was painful."""
0," Dialogue is terse and predictable, and the sci-fi thriller portion is even less compelling than the Western saga."
0,"As a vanity project, the film is more tolerable than Purple Rain but it's every bit as obvious and redundant."
0, Ambitious and reverent reboot may not manage to satisfy either purists or modern moviegoing audiences.
0," Matt Damon spends far too much of this film in awe, and rather than make you think, it is simply boring. "
0," This new Peter Pan tries to be a mix of everything we saw this summer, but in the end the movie feels pretentious and boring. [Full review in Spanish]"
1,Mendes has embraced the general super-ness of Bond and taken his inspiration from the best superhero flick of recent years: The Dark Knight.
1," The thorny dialogue, the rancorous arguments, the unexplained surliness of Lawrence's son -- all that nasty stuff melts away, covering up plot weaknesses in a warm glow of nuclear-family bonhomie."
0," The Red Riding Hood trailer was roundly mocked by some sceptics, who said it looked like Twilight in a puce cloak. A disgustingly cynical notion...that's turned out to be one hundred per cent correct."
1," With Hunnam's strong performance and the thoughtful script, we're not seeing something no one has seen before, but it's a mostly worthy trek all the same."
1," The film's approach suits an audience broader than the usual documentary crowd, though it's worth mentioning that those pictures can really stay with you."
1," It may lack the fresh irreverence and excitement of the first adventure, but there are noteworthy set pieces."
0," Sam Rockwell is a kick, but the rest of the film runs rather flat."
0, A romance novel of a movie featuring the world's most stereotypical librarian.
1,"Messier than a raging kegger, but game leads and a high gag-count keep the comedy-sequel comedown at bay. Just."
0," A stodgy movie that mixes dubious history with a clichéd, Madame Butterfly romance story, set in the period immediately following Japan's surrender in 1945."
1," Without TREMÉ, BEASTS would not have worked for me, and compared to TREMÉ, BEASTS is little more than a slight, forgettable diversion."
1, Cross faces the rather challenging task of sustaining a narrative that dislikes pretty much every character that inhabits it. But that's also what makes the film audacious - you've got to admire Cross's consistency.
0, A large step backwards for a promising director and far from the return we'd been hoping for.
0," You can feel the Wachowskis trying to inject a sense of humor into ""Jupiter Ascending."" But too often the laughs derive from unintentional self-parody related to the grandiose over-reach of the Wachowskis' ""world-building."""
1," To her credit, [director Amy Everson] is fearless, fully committed to a character with her same name and occupation."
0, Takes the viewer on an event-filled but ultimately tiresome trudge through the by-now-familiar psychosexual marshes of Lars von Trier's imagination.
0," Winter's War is a kind of poor man's Lord of the Rings, only if you swapped out Sauron with Elsa from Disney's Frozen."
1, Arthur Christmas manages to deliver some holiday cheer.
1,Delivers dark laughs and heady excitement until it runs out of gas -- and ideas -- in its last half hour.
0," ... feels manipulative yet emotionally distant, and despite some powerful moments, the film squanders a talented ensemble cast."
1," Representante máximo do noir, conta com uma trama fascinante, atuações impecáveis, fotografia e direção irretocáveis e, é claro, diálogos inesquecíveis."
0," A thoroughly stodgy exploration of the ghosts of the past that has exceedingly little to say about the Vietnam era, the ethics of violent protest or the standards of what's left of the newspaper business."
1," Quantum of Solace offers next to no solace, if we mean respite, but in plunging its hero into a revenge-displacement grudge mission, it has the compensation of a rock-solid dramatic idea, and the intelligence to run and run with it."
1," Life Itself celebrates the human condition and all of its complications with humuor, poignancy and love."
1, The jokes are hit-and-miss. But Stone is one sassy babe and a breakout star who nails every zinger and brings genuine warmth to her scenes with her parents.
0," Despite an appealing cast that includes Toni Braxton and Cedric The Entertainer, Kingdom Come won't leave you with a happy feeling -- and it may just leave you feeling surly."
0," In the tradition of Angel Heart, it looks to stir cultural anxiety by introducing a pretty white thing into a sinister world where ""black"" magic reigns supreme."
0, The film lacks both the personality and central figure (as well as the all-important sense of humor) that made last year's similar An Inconvenient Truth so watchable.
1, Taron Egerton turns a film full of cliches into something memorable. [Full review in Spanish]
0," It's a story that cries out for both parties to express a gamut of colours, but Hooper opts for nothing more chaotic than resignation, followed by love and acceptance, all dressed up by a selection of costumes and period architecture."
1, A weird and wonderful anti-biopic
1," The van becomes a microcosm of the world outside: chaotic, out of control, cruel, but broken intermittently by glimpses of humour and humanity. "
1," Well-crafted, sympathetic and apparently fairly honest, but not as novel as it would have been in the pre-reality TV era, when the home lives of participants in obsessive family units and strange subcultures weren't an entertainment staple."
0," [Michael] Bay didn't set out to make a film about Pearl Harbor. He set out to make a TITANIC clone that would go ""Ka-ching"" at the box office . . . Try TORA TORA TORA instead."
1, Don't expect dancing camels and singing sphinxes.
1, The coming-of-age of a young girl in Italy as a hard worker and a resilient person.
0, The film's effects just don't do the concept justice.
0," ""The Best Man Holiday"" gives holidays a bad name."
1, There are gaping chasms in the story and side stories that go nowhere. Yet the power of [Philip Seymour] Hoffman's performance is so hypnotic you forgive the film's faults just to revel in his all-consuming portrayal of a man possessed by his own beliefs.
1," Reminiscent of Fanny and Alexander and rich in detail and story, this unhurried, novelistic movie is worth looking into."
0," Unsure if it's supposed to make you love or loathe all the ugly behavior and cheap gags, Observe and Report will make you squirm for all the wrong reasons."
1," Background graphics burst past the stage and into the foreground - a flashy, amusingly distracting gimmick that feels true to the band it accompanies."
1," Irreverent, mature, deeply affecting drama about siblings."
0," All the eye candy in the world can't mask the sensation that you've seen this all before...and done better. Too bad the movie's script wasn't given the same attention as its sleek, brave-new-world look."
0," If there's anything new under the sun in the YA world, unfortunately, it doesn't appear to exist in The 5th Wave. If you've seen this story once, you've seen it all."
1,[Adams has] got a wild-eyed spark that suggests she's probably game for just about anything. I hope Hollywood doesn't sand her down too much and turn her into a bland star.
0," The film goes off the rails in the final third, sacrificing subtle character work at the altar of blood-and-guts survival horror. As mood-killers go, it's like a jab to the back of the neck."
0," In all, Insurgent may work as a deafening, frivolous diversion for viewers who can ignore the flimsiness of its universe, plot, and characters. "
1," I wouldn't describe it as a film that will have a profound impact on your psyche. It is however a visually delightful, beautifully acted tale."
0," It's Middlebrow Realism, comrades."
1," Some films you think you know well, until you revisit them, and are struck all over again by that sense of wonder that moved you in the first place."
0," Secrets, lies, sex, moles, traitors, CIA and Russian Intelligence pave the way for the action, but by the time the final confrontation takes place, it is difficult to care about who did what to whom. "
0,"Despite splendid scenery and an appealing Julia Roberts, the film of Elizabeth Gilbert's best-seller about her year-long spiritual quest fails to capture the humor and uplift of the book."
1, Its love for its subject - as a performer but even moreso as a person - is palpable enough that the good vibes are hard to shake.
0," The vivid fantasy visuals provide wonderful imagery in this sequel about demi-gods and their quests, although to its detriment, the film is plot heavy and lacking in its emotional arc. It is pretty silly, too"
0,"It is a masterful performance but, for me, not enough to make me a fan of the film."
0," I enjoy a crazy car chase as much as the next person, but I prefer them to come wrapped in a context that makes me care about who's chasing whom, and why."
0," Abattoir feels like it should still have an ""Under Construction"" sign warning viewers of the unfinished business to come."
1," The script by director Paul Haggis and Bobby Moresco has a scolding air to it, and watching the movie is like taking a dose of castor oil -- probably good for us but not a lot of fun."
0," You like 'splosions and special effects? Hey, you got 'em. But for anyone over the age of 12, this hardly makes up for lead-footed plotting or the fact these metal machines can't even stay consistent within their own mythology."
1, The tone in Killer Joe feels so expertly and delicately crafted that we only laugh at the film's absurd scenarios if and when the filmmaker permits it so.
0," Ms. Epperlein and Mr. Tucker have talent and resolve - they spent months shooting ""Fightville,"" a commitment that's scarcely evident - which makes the movie's superficiality all the more frustrating."
1, The gentle and kind-hearted message that this family feature offers viewers is something that we could all use in our lives
1," The film's final scenes might feel a little predictable, but overall Lion is an admirable example of the way a personal story can shed light on broader issues such as identity, poverty and global inequality. "
1," A smart, streamlined slasher with plenty under the bonnet."
0, [P]ointless -- and frequently downright distasteful -- remake... Great Recession? What Great Recession?
1, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire might be the best time you have at the movies all year.
1," Luckily there's no such thing as too much Jason Segel and Paul Rudd goofing around, but I Love You Man comes dangerously close to it."
1, Casey Affleck gives one of the strongest performances of 2007...
0," It's clear that Russell Crowe has poured his heart and soul into the historical romance The Water Diviner, his first feature as a director. If only the film were better."
1," It would be unfair to spoil the surprises in David Farrier and Dylan Reeve's investigative documentary Tickled, but the premise should be enough to draw you in."
0," Like the gods, the trading cards are capricious, with ever-changing rules and strategies so intricate that only Yu-Gi-Ohlogists will fully enjoy this adventure."
0, At no point are we invited to care about any of these people.
0," When you hear the late-night thunder and see the ragged hole in the ground from which the boy has emerged, you may wish this 'Odd Life' had been conceived by Stephen King rather than Ahmet Zappa."
0," When a set of characters are trapped 47 meters down in a cage surrounded by sharks, the narrative's potential is far from endless. In the hands of a better director, however, that potential could have been fully realised."
1," The real find, above all else, is Mike Birbiglia himself. He's as sure of a natural in front of the camera as he is behind it."
1, Baker & Bergoch's examination of the low class and welfare lifestyle in Florida is eye opening and at times hard to watch.
0," Journey to the Center of the Earth isn't playing in 3-D in every theater, but that's the only way to see it. Even then you have to wait until the last half-hour for the good stuff."
0, Exploits the very trend it condemns.
1, Paul Rudd and a strong ensemble enliven this comic tale of a homeless hippie who disrupts the more conventional lives of his three New York City sisters.
1, The Florida Project completely turns the American dream and shows us the devastated backyard of Donald Trump's tacky America. [Full review in Spanish]
1,"One of the most entertaining and exciting animated features ever made, one of those rare sequels that bests its predecessor."
0, All too quickly ... the smoke clears and Now You See Me proves to be less than meets the eye.
0,How can a blood-soaked crime story take all the elements of classic neo-noir thrillers and become a perfect storm of tedium?
0, ...an audacious yet hopelessly uninvolving art-house thriller that peters out significantly in the buildup to its anticlimactic finale.
0," The movie follows a tired formula almost from the start. It's a long road, and we see every twist coming from miles away."
1," An odd but enjoyable concoction of biography, music commentary and concert."
0," An interesting story alone isn't enough, and Tag struggles to turn its unique premise into an impressive full length feature."
1," The movie gets the beats and rhymes down pat, but the life part is a little messy. Oh well, two out of three ain't bad."
1," It is the darkest movie - visually, psychologically and spiritually - that Denis has made. It's also one of the rarest of cinematic objects - a completely contemporary, disturbingly relevant film noir."
0, The film's action sequences are a jumble of movement and cuts that have no discernible relation to the actual motion of the characters. 
0," A derivative, fetid and ugly exorcism horror flick."
1," Nolfi suppresses high style, however, for a clean and spare look: a sparsely populated Manhattan, crisp light, subtle visual jokes and rhymes. It's a well-chosen tactic."
0, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo can't quite transcend its junk foundation or...the familiar beats of the other adaptation.
0, Ivan Reitman parece ter acreditado que bastava colocar Billy Crystal e Robin Williams juntos e gritar 'Ação!'. Não basta.
0," As scary and minor-chord heavy as FearDotCom can be, there's no big payoff, no logical resolution. It's like waiting for a site to download, only to find that when it happens, anticipation was more than half of the empty thrill."
0,Full of local flavor.
0," This is no Zoolander, folks."
1, Marking has a good eye for capturing the contradictions of Afghanistan.
0,"While Letters to God is certainly family-friendly, the blandness robs it of whatever emotion or redemption the filmmakers were shooting for."
0, Bryan Singer proves that he no longer has any interesting X-Men stories to tell.
0," A forgiving viewer may wonder if there's method in its moronity: Creedence Clearwater Revival's anti-war classic 'Fortunate Son' blares over the end credits, as if in veiled insult to audience members who cheered the movie's Hollywoodized warmongering."
1," Despite all these big personalities stuffed into a two-hour film, Thor: Ragnarok is an airtight affair that skilfully plays to each actor's strength."
0, A dumb and cheesy period potboiler...Quoth this critic: It's a bore.
1, that rare first-time gem that does everything remarkably well
1,Interesting and distinctive but held back from greatness by forcing complex characters through tidy character arcs.
0," With so much going for it, including being adapted from a best-selling children's book, it was a real surprise to me that the film overall was unsatisfying. The whole wound up being less than the sum of its parts..."
0, Broder settles for a broadly played comedy in which the disabled are never really that disabled and intolerance stems more from naivete than from genuine malice.
1, Ben Affleck's ceiling as a filmmaker could be considerably higher than anyone expected.
0," The director invests his filmmaking with so much bawdy, darkly comic energy that it's all the more perplexing that ""Tale of Tales"" never quite stirs to life."
1, Cute if predictable.
0," Though it ought to have inspired something tremendously amusing, the movie functions like a rally of egos down at the story conference workshop."
0, The film's narrative conceit is so rigidly formulaic and lethargically spun that even the looseness and spontaneity that the setting affords feels dull and constricting.
1," So many films have concentrated on the horrors of war, but none in my recent memory has dealt with the tedium."
1," The film expertly gives the main characters their moments without detracting from the main story, and does so with dialogue that's Hell or High Water-style offbeat and witty. "
0," When the video game-to-movie thing becomes this literal, it only makes you wonder why anyone would want to see a big-screen Doom at all."
1," It's gruelling at times, but the film is extraordinary and unflinching. And remarkably, it's made with as much love as anger."
1," Jimi: All Is by My Side is an evocative, probing, enlightening, and impressionistic look at the lesser-known period of Hendrix's life."
1,"The chemistry within the cast has survived the long separation, and although some of the reappearances don't exactly serve the story, they certainly contribute to the atmosphere."
0," Bobin, who can do low-key, as in TV's Flight of the Conchords, and keyed-up, as in Muppets Most Wanted, goes no-key in Alice Through the Looking Glass. He directs so anonymously, it's as if he's imitating Burton on a bad day."
0," The best that can be said about this dull, overlong project is that it is at least pretty to look at. "
0," In the same way much conventional wisdom about the war is half-baked, The Lucky Ones is awash in stereotypes and generalities."
0, A movie with more plot than it can comfortably handle.
0," If there's one thing these early-20-somethings don't deserve, it's sympathy..."
0, [It] doesn't bring anything new to the table.
0," Bello is an excellent actress and makes Sophie's anguish credible, although she can't rise above the material."
0," This dichotomy between what the film insists is Jobs at his best, and what we the audience see as Jobs at his arguable worst undermines the overall message and what we are supposed to take away from the movie."
0, Four-year-olds - and 34-year-olds - deserve better.
1, A good if undistinguished capper to the trilogy.
0," To be sure, there's often nothing quite as liberating as a raunchy, foul-mouthed comedy, but the R-rated moments have to be woven into the storyline, not just sprayed onto the screen like a wayward money shot in a porn flick."
0," No major blockbuster in years has been this incoherently structured, this seemingly uninterested in telling a story with clarity and purpose."
0," Niccol's major problem is timing: action sequences and dialogue scenes lie flat on the screen, while his tendency to play around with pacing means that any tension quickly dissipates. Life's too short."
0, It's as sanitized and closed-off as the carefully sealed room where Katie spends most of her days.
1," The dialogue cuts like a knife, and the two lead performances, by Steve Buscemi and Sienna Miller, have an electrifying emotional focus -- neither actor has ever been more mesmerizing."
0," Well-nigh unendurable...though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry, it remains depressingly prosaic and dull."
1," As a portrait of what it's like to be suddenly helpless, Abuse Of Weakness is never less than fascinating ..."
1, I think the biggest surprise for some will be how little Del Toro is missed.
0," There are moments of wit in the script, and one or two strong scenes, but the film feels oddly directionless for much of its runtime."
1," Although Inglourious Basterds is not the best representation of Tarantino's genius, he can do no wrong, even if it is sometimes misguided and laborious."
1, Manages to be impressively unsettling given the flaws in its foundation.
0,Parts of this romantic science fiction story are undeniably interesting. Others require a strong suspension of disbelief and even then I was scratching my head.
0, The film is technically accomplished. But there is something meagre and futile about it.
1,"All in all, this is a smart, charming and endearing film."
1, Just because the film manages to evoke a reaction doesn't mean it's good -- just that its actors have done a fine job conveying a connection the script lacked.
0, Eventually it just stalls.
1,Succinctly demonstrates we've both come a long way and have a long way to go.
1," Tuned in to two key elements: the joyfulness of Steven Spielberg's ET, and the perennial chase of Tom and Jerry cartoons. "
1," The film eschews a Hollywood happy ending in favor of bone-chilling reality, which makes Viper Club doubly relevant amid current headlines."
1, Hoffman the director can't compete with Hoffman the film's star. And he can pretty much just stand in wonder at the layers co-star Amy Ryan brings to the party. The woman is a natural wonder.
0, Notable mainly for the amount of ammo it expends while rarely if ever hitting the target.
0, Jindabyne never obtains the full impact of its potentially powerful inner core.
0," Rango never shuts up, but he never has anything funny or touching or clever to say."
1, Enough sleek cartooning and swashbuckling action to satisfy young and old audiences alike.
1," If your tastes run to the slightly bizarre and weird - then ""Adaptation"" is for you."
0," The narrative drifts, and those extravagant effects, paradoxically, make the film eminently forgettable, or at least indistinguishable from every other CGI-heavy assault on our senses."
0, ... the picture ranks among the year's most confounding and flawed.
1, This enjoyable doc records a Hollywood master looking back at his career with lucid hindsight and irony.
1,"Although perhaps unlikely to become a classic passed on from generation to generation, there is a lot to like in this enjoyable, fun adventure. "
1," An expert blend of silly fun, action that is mostly more exciting than scary, a few clever barbs, and some sheer bravura visuals."
1," McConaughey's nonstop energy and his character's will to survive carries the film, even in its most conventional moments."
0, Effective acting and Tanya Wexler's direction of a taboo topic (especially given the era in which it's set) cannot save the unbearably choppy and uneven writing of the movie.
0, The only crudeness here is in the uninspired filmmaking and a washed-out look.
1, An elegant film about an irresistible hot romance.
1," Where Guan excels is in straight dramatization, like the moving, beautifully acted reconciliation in a restaurant between gruff father and impatient son."
1," This poignant indie has a lot going for it. Not only is there a finely wrought slice-of-life lesson here, but there's also a wonderful cast playing it out, lead by a surprisingly wonderful Will Ferrell."
1, A magnificent movie -- made a masterpiece by Audrey Tautou.
1," While its cinematic impact may not quite rise to the hubristic heights some have speculated, it is as bold and audacious a step in that direction as cinema has ever seen."
0, Plays like a giant warning to get out of town before Cheaper by the Dozen 2 opens.
1, What's truly frightening about Scary Movie is that parts of it are actually funny.
0, Just not quite daring or spectacular enough.
1," As is, Jones is entertaining, but would have been a lot better if it wasn't geared toward families."
0," At times, ""Super"" seems like ""Watchmen,"" but with only two superheroes, far fewer special effects and none of the visionary one-time elan of Zack Snyder."
0," It was less terrible than I feared, but still fell well short of being good."
1,"While the package as a whole never truly strikes a consistent tone, the boundless energy, surprisingly irreverent dialogue, and creative action sequences carry the day."
1,"Spy Kids is all fun, sometimes obnoxious, and incessantly cheerful."
0," The movie remains admittedly entertaining, mainly because it's so shamelessly ridiculous that you can't believe an Oscar-winning actor (Jamie Foxx) can get through this thing with a straight face."
1,"As with most romantic comedies, Failure to Launch takes off thanks to its upbeat tone and the charisma of its stars."
1," If Tim Burton made a Harry Potter movie, it might look something like this gothic wedding cake of a flick, all evil curlicues and black lace..."
1,"In the hands of Cate Blanchett, who is wondrous and magnetic as always, and Rooney Mara, who has never been better or more touching, the movie becomes unforgettable."
1," The film is at its most compelling when we hear Lear's voice - or just watch him, seated on a theatrically lit but empty stage, thumbing through scrapbooks and smiling or wincing at memories."
0," Claustrophobic, basically unexciting and heavy-handed."
1, How much you appreciate the film will largely depend on how effective you feel its big revelation is.
0," The picture has a knockabout charm, thanks to the actors; but its premise seems flawed."
0," The film slumps into the doldrums early on, and truth is, it never recovers. For a film so heavy on characters, it's shamefully light on plot."
0, Metaphor at the cost of art is too high a price to pay.
1, Terrific filmmaking that plays at the level of instinct and emotion.
0,"Crossover has too much going for it. It has a wonderful message about making smart life choices, but the story shuffles among too many subjects -- sports, romance, friendship -- to let audiences hear it clearly."
0, What to expect when you're watching What to Expect When You're Expecting? Not much. 
0," Listen, I have a family."
0, We begin with Jolie blonde and beaten. We later realize she can handle herself. It's just that the mission she's on doesn't matter.
0," Too oblique, too arch."
0, A crudely written and wholly uninspired thriller that's unlikely to win anyone over to the horror master's oeuvre.
0, The Door in the Floor is a film about child abuse. The filmmakers either don't realize this or don't have the courage to admit it.
1, They don't call him Martin Scorsese for nothing you know!
1, It is a deeply moving and heartfelt story that makes an indelible impression on the viewers' hearts and minds.
0," What's really annoying about Entanglement,... but can do no better than coincidence. That's not quantum entanglement, that's flat storytelling."
0," Kebbell portrays Doom not as a dictator with supreme technical and sorcerous powers, but a video game playing beardo with daddy issues (to be fair, they all have daddy issues)."
1," Shane Meadows has taken a traumatic moment of violence from his own childhood, together with the themes of victimisation, bullying and thuggery from Dead Man's Shoes, and set the action in 1983, about the time of his own experience with skinheads"
1,"Subplots of treachery and revenge make this play like The Eiger Sanction, but Vertical Limit shows you can go pretty far with enough funny lines and well-crafted action sequences."
1," Many of the gags early on are aimed at older cinemagoers, but once the potty humour starts in earnest younger patrons will soon catch up on the giggle count."
0," The feature debut of writer-director Randy Moore has a juicy cultural totem in its sights, the Disney empire, but it misses more than it hits."
0," An awful ensemble comedy to complete that Valentine's Day / New Year's Eve box-set, complete with sexist clichés."
0, Vijay Antony is terrible in the film as he looks clueless as to how to play a double role. He can't do better than speaking in monotone and looking sad all the time.
0," Wants to be 'Hostel,' but it's just half-witted."
0, Not since [Halloween] has a horror franchise managed to squander all of its early potential in quite as few steps.
1," Still more engaging than most moviemaking, but nonetheless a letdown after such a long wait."
0, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is dark and dour through and through.
0," If Cameron were more prepared to challenge our expectations, Avatar might have been what he intended. Instead, it's a beautiful folly, a technical wonder that represents a failure of nerve."
0," Beauty and the Beast will come as a colossal disappointment, bringing back into focus an elephant-sized question that nostalgia doesn't want us to answer: what exactly is the point of these live-action reimaginings?"
1," As with the first ""Ice Age"" movie it is Scrat the acorn-obsessed rodent who bookends the movie and steals the most laughs with his hilarious attempts at obtaining an ever-elusive acorn."
0," Even by the debased standards of preachy sports movies aimed at kids, this is pabulum."
0," By gilding the lily so shamelessly, Ewing and Grady guarantee they'll preach only to the converted."
0," As an actor, Meryl Streep is incapable of making false moves. That doesn't mean she's incapable of making false movies."
1, Thumpingly exhilarating ...
1," With viewer (and creative) fatigue setting in, to whom can Marvel Studios turn to for re-invigoration? A cocky doctor with mystical, mind-expanding powers and even more mystical facial hair? Sure, that'll kill two hours."
1, Screamingly urgent and contemporary.
1," Whatever the case, an excellent Carell - not Chalamet - is the most haunting player in this moving tragedy."
1, Not everything works... [but] Anon is spot on when it comes to our growing angst about snooping and sharing.
1," Not every cute movie about the mentally ill is Oscar worthy, but this touching and riotous one from Down Under works well enough."
0," The movie poster declares INSPIRED BY THE ACTUAL ACCOUNTS OF AN NYPD SERGEANT, as if that's supposed to impress anyone."
1," The film's premise could so easily have lent itself to very broad comedy, which would have been right inside Vince Vaughn's wheelhouse. Yet the movie takes a richer, more character-driven route, and Vaughn is clearly up to the challenge."
0," It's just that - well, it's a bit thin."
1,"It's uneven story pulls it back to earth, but many of its ideas are transcendent."
1,"So, is Selma the film I wanted? No. Is is a good film? Yes, but it's not great."
1, This isn't a life changing movie but there are a few points of difference that make Home Again worth watching.
0," This is a different look for him, and I'm fine with what he does, stepping in to a dramatic role. I have issues with this film because it wants to play off that ""inspired by a true film"" a bit too much."
1," DP Claire Mathon's lensing keeps pace with the action without overdoing the handheld dynamic, giving the film a compelling physical vitality that happens to be one of [Thierry] de Peretti's key strengths."
1," A terrific turn by Douglas, and strong support, elevates this character-driven drama above its unlikeable protagonist."
1, An all-time great zombie film.
1,"The movie is pretty funny, but O'Hara is a howl."
1, Capitalism: A Love Story is a Michael Moore movie that Fox News viewers might like.
0, Agony. A penance to sit through. When was the last time thirty people lectured you in a dream?
0, Bride Wars takes every ugly stereotype about women and weddings and dumbs them down even further.
0," In 1999, apparently, you need to be more socially responsible in your portrayals of high school horn-dogs."
0," Cox has managed to recruit great actors only to elicit bafflingly melodramatic and stilted work. Emma Roberts, as an aspiring artist and the only female character with more than a couple speaking lines, is particularly wasted."
0," Though shooting to be an art film, it never rises above being a moderately diverting escapist action film."
1," The real acid test is your reaction to the sight of a pagoda-high pile of furious, computer-generated dragons. Bring it on? Then The Great Wall might just be for you."
0, Turistas doesn't have much going for it beyond its xenophobic subtext about trusting young Americans and crude and crafty foreigners. The action scenes are so dark as to be unfathomable. The characters are so alike as to be indistinguishable.
1," An unusual love story that deals with complex issues, both personal and socio-political."
0, Breaking Dawn starts to confirm my theory that Twilight is just a tamer version of The Story of O.
1,"Desk Set is a big, shiny, doohickey coasting on the warm offerings of earlier triumphs."
1," ...moves along at a brisk clip and features a bright, vibrant animation style..."
1," The bottom line is that It is one of the better Stephen King film adaptations, but falls short of the pantheon..."
1," A wittily efficient quickie, the film is a winner all the way - a surprise, since Starrett's career thus far had been the movie director's equivalent of a criminal record. "
1," Uma trama curiosa e efeitos visuais ainda eficazes (embora ultrapassados, obviamente) garantiram que este filme envelhecesse bem."
1," Escape Room lives and dies on its ability to execute its own conceit, which is does more or less flawlessly."
0," For me, 3 Ninjas had its amusing moments but was also tedious at times."
1,This in-your-face homage to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the most unrelentingly sadistic flick to come out of Hollywood in quite some time.
1," In an era when life happens quicker than it (used to), ""Boyhood"" offers an oasis of quietude, one that viewers will only enjoy if they are willing to slow down and leave their watches at home."
0," When the trailers for the film tell you... the big, astonishing twist, you end up spending the first 45 minutes of the movie wondering when the damn movie is going to start."
0, An incoherent and disappointing sequel made exclusively for gaming fans. 
1," Kate Beckinsale's ""Selene"" remains one-note, but it's a wildly entertaining note."
1, A frothy bit of entertainment that never gets tired of the glow that radiates off Rachel McAdams.
0," Trust us when we say from here it only gets more contrived, mawkish, implausible, a little bit offensive and occasionally so ludicrous it's funny."
1," With a playful spirit and decent comedy, The Gold Seeker recaptures the delights of the adventure genre. [Full Review in Spanish] "
0, Eva Mendes is the new Raquel Welch but even Raquel/Eva can't make this movie work
0," The movie punches out broad entertainment for little kids effectively, and I predict excellent returns. But the only spark of real comedy was Bill Bailey's relaxed cameo as a local farmer with a reverence for the intellect of pigs."
0," You ought to have a movie that's both smart and sexy. But Jennifer's Body is neither. Most damning of all, it's not scary."
1," A surprising return to form for the venerated director, recalling (if not matching) his best work from the 80's."
1," A yearning, bruising vision of unpracticed adolescent desire."
0,"Family comedies about Martians don't need to be plausible exactly, but they need to be smart and entertaining. This one is ho-hum, so-so and so what?"
1," The film is so good-natured and pleasant and simple that I can't not recommend it. It's a disappointment in a lot of ways, but it's sure an upbeat one."
1, 'Intimate Strangers' is a charming French romance that unravels with mounting intrigue.
1," There has always been something so inward about [Theron;] she can seem detached or deprived. But here it's as if the script and the direction felt bound to heed that loneliness, and let the actress go with her bravery and the depressive sag of her mouth."
0," 'The Inbetweeners 2' is riddled with contempt: for its characters, for its audience and most notably for the entire female gender."
0, Excruciating stuff.
0, Few things are quite as frustrating as a film that chooses a highly controversial subject then proceeds to give it the kid-glove treatment.
1," Part teen rom-com, part sci-fi contemplation of weighty concepts, the anarchy and confusion of life has rarely felt so vivid, honest or enchanting."
0, Under de Bont's tutelage the franchise has shifted from amiably plodding but unique to relentlessly plodding and generic.
0," If you're bored and want to see a summer popcorn flick, The Mummy might be mildly satisfying."
1," In time, we may get tired of this type of character from Gerwig, but for right now, she remains a joy to watch."
0, This medium-octane farce is neither as uproarious as its star and set-up promise nor as inept as every other studio picture released in recent weeks.
1," Despite the last 10 minutes, there's much to like in Cruel Intentions."
1," New Englanders, with both the dialog and locations, will feel at home in this small town saga, captured skillfully by cinematographer Jody Lee Lipes."
1,"Because it never quite reaches its enormous potential, Secondhand Lions feels like a disappointment even though there's much to praise."
0," ...maladroit dans sa tentative d'allier rires et frissons, insatisfaisant sur tous les plans..."
0,"Though intermittently amusing and exhilarating, Taking Woodstock can't quite pull together its threads into one totally trippy tapestry."
1," It's not groundbreaking and will appeal to horror fans mostly, but Kerslake, and the excellent Quinn Markey, give it a dramatic centre."
1," While ""Labor Day"" isn't the stuff of blockbusters, or Oscar juggernauts, it is a simple, adult romance, made for grownups by grownups, about love and second chances."
0," The first of two sequels shot in immediate succession, Dead Man's Chest bears the unenviable burden of racking the pins for both movies, which leaves it with precious few opportunities to have a little fun of its own."
0," Sarah Gavron's focus on one character helps lift the film above slogans and marches, and makes it more personal. But when the fight becomes more of a war we lack the attachment to the movement's biggest losses."
1," Confronting the horrors of history head-on can make for cinema that's impossible to shake, but Katabuchi's painterly, introspective film proves a sideways approach can be just as indelible."
1," A worst-case scenario that preys on parental fears of the monster movie lurking within every teenage rebellion, and it's fed by memories of what we got away with when we were young."
0," The kind of spectacular failure that requires all participants to be on the same page, working together as one with fevered commitment toward making a disaster, ""The Circle"" couldn't be timelier or more exasperating."
1," I don't think the movie will appeal to a wide audience, but I could see it becoming a perennial cult classic, right up there with Repo Man."
0," This isn't cinema so much as Sunday evening television, with a moral dilemma laid out in straight-arrow scenes stripped of much cinematic sensibility."
0," Ride Along 2 is an uninspired retread of its predecessor, but manages to reach the (low) bar set for this action/comedy franchise."
0,"...has plenty of energy and affection, but not much purpose."
0, You're likely to want to pluck out your eyeballs.
1," Overall, Neighbors 2 is not as good as the original, but fans of the first film will still find enough humor here to make it worth a look."
0," He's not really a wolf - he's more like a hyena, a scavenger, a bottom-feeder. Why would you want to know his story?"
0, The Way Back is fascinating until it becomes an ordeal.
1," Harris displays a quiet, unshowy confidence and a genuine fondness for the genre, capturing the horses and guns and saloon glasses in a soft, almost-sundown light."
0," Obvious, broad and burdened by leaden lines of dialogue that are dropped here and there like demented coconuts."
1,"It's fast-paced amusing fluff if you wanna, ""Stay loose, stay liquid and laugh a lot."
1," ""Neon Bull"" is a profound reflection on the intersection of the human and bestial."
0, It's fun for about the first ten minutes.
1, Sentimental touches underscore the fun and frivolity of Bond's past while relishing the brutal landscape of the modern day super-spy.
1," A moving new film by one of Africa's best directors, A Screaming Man won the jury prize at Cannes last year and deserves a wider audience than the continent's great movies often achieve."
1, Wrenching drama about child custody can spark discussion.
0," It's going to take more than a new set of hub caps and some fluffy dice to reimagine this franchise, which is clearly up on the blocks."
0," Being directed by Michael Bay, you will probably go in expecting a lot of action and explosions ... but this is clearly the Bay of Pearl Harbor and Armageddon"
0," Outside of the moments of kinetic madness that represent the action sequences, this movie is an amalgamation of lame comedy, campy Eastern mysticism, and dumb plotting."
1," Despite the lapses in dialogue, what never flagged was the magnificence of the photography and in the end, it is those breathtaking images the left the deepest impression."
0, Few films are worse to sit through than comedies that don't work. Step Brothers is one of those.
1, A charming documentary about a long-married Hollywood couple who made many important contributions to American movies.
1," Runs smoothly and efficiently for its first 90 minutes, effectively mixing dark humor, social commentary, and pure story- and character-driven entertainment."
0," Life During Wartime, which feels like a movie made to fulfill a contractual obligation, says nothing new, nothing that Happiness didn't already say, only better."
0," With a highly flawed script full of completely unlikeable characters, Beeba Boys just repeatedly misses the mark."
0," It's really easy to sum up everything that's wrong with Ben Affleck's ""Live By Night"": It should have been a miniseries."
0," Also about a demanding public physical activity, Darren Aronofsky's pretentious 'Black Swan' is a giant step down from 'The Wrestler.'"
1, Osment is heartbreakingly true to his character as a boy at a crossroads.
1, It seems impossible that this comedy does not touch the guts of those who are the most usual spectators in theaters where the film will be shown. [Full Review in Spanish]
0, What a dreary sendoff for Hoffman.
1," America's covert war against the Mexican drug cartels gets a bracing, brutal working over by the director Denis Villeneuve."
1," Though it will take snobs another decade or so to admit it, here lies the end of a major landmark in film history."
0," Sacha Baron Cohen has nearly succeeded in his quest to be the film equivalent to Howard Stern. Crude and crass rather than challenging, shocking rather than stimulating, Cohen doesn't seem to care what he does so long as he gets people talking."
1," So studiously controlled that it's not an easy picture to watch, but you won't forget it."
0," hough Bobby won't make you forget Marcello Mastroianni's Matteo Scuro, the once-great thespian doesn't coast here in his understated performance as widower Frank Goode."
1, A relentlessly gripping werewolf thriller. One of the best horror films of recent years.
0," [It] isn't so much a movie as a canny, inoffensive slice of brand management and marketing. And as such, it's not half bad."
0," It's well-acted, with some occasional moments of clever dialogue, but the story is plodding, predictable and tension-free."
0," There are a few legitimate scares in the film, but they don't stick with you like those in the first Insidious."
0, Ham-handed revenge-porn.
0," He's got the buff body, noble intentions and cool costume, but not much more. Captain America makes for a better propaganda symbol than superhero."
1, A fascinating character study and a brilliantly crafted drama. It has some of the wittiest writing in recent memory and spot-on performances.
1," It's a steady, solid film that gets the job done. If you can ride out the slow, action-deprived stretches, you might come away with similar opinions."
1,"The story is ridiculous and not every plot point makes sense, but if you're willing to turn your brain off and abandon any second thinking, the entertainment value is high."
0," For those seeking a ""so bad it's great"" viewing experience, it somehow manages to fall short of those dubious charms."
0, The film's desolate and mannered tone proves more frustrating than it does provocative.
1," From Valentino Garavani's imperious carriage and diva fits to his coterie of tiny dogs, the subject of Tyrnauer's doc comes off like a fictional character, scripted by a writer with a weakness for cliché."
0," Perhaps the only redeeming factor is that both the President and the First Lady are devoted to their daughter. Otherwise, this film should be impeached."
0, I almost wonder if this whole movie should've been a dream where The Rock died at the beginning...that's how bad it is.
0," I was sorry to see the zombie crows from the last film make only a token appearance here, but this was balanced by a return of the zombie Dobermans from the first movie."
0," ...Sean Penn seems to have wandered out of Warren Beatty's 1990 ""Dick Tracy"" and screenwriter Will Beall (TV's 'Castle') takes liberties that O'Mara never fought for. "
1, Jenkins' feature flips back through time to deliver an origin story that functions beautifully on its own while also bolstering excitement for the franchise's future.
0," Boyle is always worth paying attention to, and McAvoy is captivting, but this twisty film is a stylish disappoint with a long, dull middle section. "
0, [Sarandon is] somehow the only star who doesn't end up looking like an overpaid idiot working miles beneath her abilities. And that's a pretty cutting thing to say when you figure in Scott's standard fratboy follies.
1," The central joke in Smallfoot is a bit corny, but if you can get past it, you'll find a fairly charming little family picture."
0," Baldwin is having a blast and that is fun to watch, but not enough to really create movie magic."
1, Crowe shows great skill in staging scenes. He finds the right pacing to get the most out of the scenes without letting them become contrived.
1," This big, broad, laugh-out-loud farce isn't in the business of deep swipes or sharp insights. Its main message is that politics pretty much makes fun of itself."
1,I think it's courageous -- it's something we're not used to seeing from this category of movies these days. A stark honesty is presented here.
1, A gripping entertainment that gets across worthwhile truths about contemporary strains of an ancient disease. 
0," Alternately clever and cliché; occasionally potent but often bumpy, the comedy is a respectable mess."
0," Until its pair of ludicrous twist endings, which complicates its message and logistics in ways that make little sense, Gabe Torres's Brake plays like a more simplistic version of Buried tailored specifically to a hawkish right-wing crowd."
1," Terminator 3 breaks the third-strike mold thanks to a pair of talented young actors, high-octane action sequences and an aging Austrian who can still hold his own."
1," Another commanding performance from Mbatha-Raw, who doesn't need words to explain how the outer emptiness of Noni's persona has found its way inside."
1," An unflinching, unforgettable glimpse at two boys who have been aged beyond their years by grinding work that they must endure for the faint hope of a different future."
0, Another clunker from Clooney aided and abetted by Wes Anderson
0," If you're going to remake (or salute) a Hitchcock classic, it's fine to start off like Disturbia. It is not fine to end up like Disturbia."
0," Like a Frankenstein monster that can never quite find the strength to climb off the table, The Goods is a lumbering creation stitched together from body parts of past comedies operating in a similarly sophomoric vein."
1,First Reformed has its steeple in the clouds and its foundation on solid ground.
0," [Mayhem] lacks the sharpness of fair like Tragedy Girls, but for fans of [Steven] Yuen or business-focused semi-satire like Horrible Bosses, it's got enough adrenaline to carry an audience along. "
1,Your reaction to the whole thing probably depends on your general feelings about Cage: Fans will relish his unique brand of scenery-chewing; non-fans are likely to be irritated.
0," Barrie's Neverland is a bubble bath with endless castles, clouds and caves waiting to be explored. Forster's is a relaxing hot tub, which is also nice, but not the same thing."
0, The impressive action sequences are...undermined by reams of clunky exposition and atrocious dialogue delivered by actors seemingly along for the ride and with no worries over the lack of quality control.
0," The Peacemaker tackles a fascinating character, but never digs beneath surface details in O'Malley's life. "
1," 'Inside Out' is original and inventive; it may not be a mind-blowing experience, but it is one of the best efforts from Pixar in several years."
1," [Renoir's] first American film... almost feels like the work of someone else, although it still contains a few of its maker's signature themes, and it's an excellent entertainment in any regard. "
1," For the most part, it's a film filled with simple pleasures..."
1, What's truly frightening about Scary Movie is that parts of it are actually funny.
1," There's nothing overtly flashy about Edgerton's direction, but he crafts some nerve-jolting scares."
0,"Resident Evil is what comes from taking John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars and eliminating the beheadings. In other words, about as bad a film you're likely to see all year."
0," ... gets smothered in pointlessly long takes, repetitive scenes, grim Western landscapes and mumbled, heavily accented dialogue."
0," Boy, are we in trouble when these two 40-somethings get into a head-butting melee at a rock concert, taking out plenty of young hooligan types, all in the name of comedy."
1, ...a breezy piece of work that does what it sets out to do with charm and aplomb.
1, After Hours is like one of those stories about a driver from out of town who takes the wrong turnoff on a big city expressway and winds up having an awful but memorable story to tell the folks back home... as long as he survives.
1, Some documentaries are designed to give information. Winged Migration provides pure sensation -- and it's sensational.
0, Bratt's performance becomes little more than a set of flashily donned 'street' attitudes.
1," Clearly inspired by a few of Hitchcock's 'train-bound' movies, Transsiberian doesn't break a lot of new ground, but it does tell a slick story in a very chilly setting."
0," Less a police drama than a cinematic force-feed, Training Day is difficult to swallow and harder still to stomach."
1," A real-life action thriller, a terrifying, companion piece to Sicario. Do we want the wild West in the 21st century? Because that's what we've got."
1," Stylized, slightly surreal, perhaps overdosing with flimsy whimsy"
0," All of the blanks that your mind filled in 25 years ago are now fleshed out, made literal, and kinda dull."
1," For all its flaws, it might just be the most heartwarming movie of the year."
0," [The writers] appear to subscribe to the 'if it sort of works once, let's beat the audience over the head with it until we've driven the life out of the joke' philosophy."
0," Zaveri takes his brain-dead audience for granted and unmindfully dishes out trite, leaving you angry and anguished."
0," The stakes are higher, the action is bigger, the ambitions are grander, the jokes are appreciably less funny. Like many comedy sequels, ""Zoolander 2"" supersizes everything so that it's that much more apparent how few of the jokes are connecting."
0, Lucas' presence looms in the flick's uneasy balance between rapt devotion and sly foreshadowing of the franchise fans' bitter days to come.
0," Fails to deliver on its class warfare premise, fizzling out just when it should be heating up."
0," Jordan takes risks in this film, but they're the wrong risks."
1," If Gene Kelly, Woody Allen and Steve Martin had a chance to collaborate, the result might be La La Land, the remarkable new movie by precocious young writer/director Damien Chazelle. "
1," The movie is akin to the last days of school after finals, when everyone is goofing around and having fun."
0, I come here not to bury Derek Zoolander - only to eugoogalise him.
1, I enjoyed the film for its surfaces most of the way. Its pictorial assurance is undeniable. So is its destiny as an audience-divider.
0, The trouble with a story like this is there's not really anywhere for it to go.
1, [Robert Reich] headlines this documentary in which he explains his views about the United States' current economic woes. It's something he manages to do engagingly and with great clarity.
0," More tawdry than titillating, what should have been sultry is more often skanky."
0," In spite of good intentions, A.C.O.D. fails to capitalize on its compelling 'Adult Children of Divorce' platform to present viewers with equally captivating insights."
0," Falls down is in its flippant approach to an idea that doesn't have any traction beyond a TV skit, about a morally bankrupt teacher in high heels trying to pay her way to a boob job"
1, Profoundly metaphorical and almost unbearably heart-wrenching in its recognition of the essential aloneness of life...
1," Bollywood's widest U.S. release to date, hitting 215 stateside screens, is ironically atypical: a romantic melodrama in English, Spanish and Hindi, with nary a dance number."
0," If you operate under the belief that you can learn as much, maybe even more, from bad movies as you can from good ones, this one is a master class in what not to do."
0," Director Paul McGuigan and screenwriter David Boula are content to rely on the usual suspects, taking their visual and dramatic cues from other, more clever and involving sci-fi capers."
1," Amy Adams is strawberry bubble gum and doesn't just chase after the performance, she boards it like a rocket and blasts off. It's equal parts adorability, cunning allure, and million-dollar charm."
0," Given all those prestigious pedigrees, Dreamcatcher should have been great, or at least bad in new and interesting ways. Instead, it shamelessly recycles plot points and themes from Alien, Independence Day even Outbreak."
0," It isn't without its charms, including an appealing cast and high production values. Unfortunately, all that's overshadowed by its inability to convincingly find emotional truths."
0," Despite solid craftsmanship and good intentions, Deepwater Horizon falters under the weight of the very real, very recent history it depicts."
1," The purpose of this comedy is to serve as a showcase for Anna Faris, whose sunny disposition and solid comic timing make The House Bunny more enjoyable than it ought to be."
0, Remember Wild Wild West? Well...
1, The Wolverine is at its best when it deals with Logan's internal struggles and helps return fans of the franchise to the modern day.
0," Uma continuação não apenas dispensável, mas que ainda consegue, em certo grau, diminuir nosso carinho pelo original."
0,"The movie is a spirited exercise in caricature rather than a cohesive comedy. Everybody's playing somebody real, but the movie never approaches reality."
0,It was hard for me to concentrate on My Dog Skip because there was someone in the theater who wouldn't shut up: the narrator.
0," They're awful cute together, even if they're awful people."
0," Frost and the cast have obviously trained hard to avoid being murder on the dance floor, but the inept script is like Strictly Come Dancing in concrete boots."
0," [A]gainst all probability, 'Money Never Sleeps' is a watchable enough movie for its first hour or so.... But as the financial bubble pops, so too does the cinematic one."
0," It moves with such turgid lack of energy that I found myself wincing, trying to smooth over the rhythm with my imagination."
1," Structurally, yes, it's loaded with all the lies, schemes and high-tech trickery that are staples of the espionage genre. But a deeper, more individualistic source of tension propels the film along."
1," Collet-Serra seems as transfixed by the landscape as he is by Lively's presence, suggesting a continuity between humanity and the natural world."
0," Set in a world of resplendent beach homes and scrubbed-clean towns, populated by genetically blessed people who wouldn't know a real concern if it smacked them in the face."
1," The testimonials are played without voice filters, horror laid bare... [Full Review in Spanish] "
1," If music were all, Gypsy Caravan would be amazing. As is, it's worth seeing, but you may get frustrated at the way Dellal raises provocative questions about ancestry and prejudice..."
1," Large-scale nonsense executed strongly and with glee has its pleasures... the last few films have had their fun moments. This one has a few, too."
1,"The exploration of the internet falls short of the joys that made the first film so compelling. At the same time, it will be a fun romp that should bring joy to the family."
1,"This is one of Moore's defining performances, and it is a brave one."
0,"Hollywood may be the dream factory, but this probably isn't the dream the filmmakers had in mind."
1," It's because Happyness gets these quiet, panicked moments of life on the margins so true that, when the expected climactic triumph comes, it's so affecting."
0," Draw a big red ""X"" through this one."
1," It's an oddly compelling story, handsomely made, and showcasing another fine role for the impressive Mia Wasikowska."
1, The contrast between Kyle's multiple layers of loss and the flurry of life that goes on without her is briefly compelling.
0," This is a scummy little sewer of a movie, a cesspool that lingers sadistically on shots of a killer terrifying and killing helpless women, and then is shameless enough to end with an appeal to law and order."
0," I understand that Eastwood meant well, and it is interesting to fill up a tried-and-true movie formula with this much frank racism in order to make it different, but Gran Torino is just a well-intentioned mess."
1,There is nothing straightforward about anyone in Paul Thomas Anderson's bewitching mystery in which each character is a stepping-stone in a journey in which no-one is quite sure who or what they are chasing
1,Mainstream telling of the making of Psycho is missing part of the story
0," Though Puss was an entertaining subsidiary character in Shrek 2, he fails to convince as a leading character."
0," Basically a live-action version of the cliche country-western song with a man down on his luck and losing everything in his life, it comes close to being a joke about itself."
0," If you watch movies chiefly for stunts and special effects, this Bond is for you. If you watch to see a beloved formula regurgitated, make tracks."
1," If you don't already love costumed adventurers, this outing won't give you any fresh incentive, but fans will learn more about their heroes."
1," there's a breezy feel to the film's aesthetic, a sense of space that feels at peace with the harsh realities of a child's sadness. "
1,Valkyrie is another entry into Cruise's canon of quality films and performances.
1," ""Book Club"" is very silly and feather-light, but let me say this: Spending time with this quartet is way more fun than reading ""Fifty Shades of Grey."""
0," An uncompromisingly tough watch, a tale of hard drugs and even stronger sex set in Liverpool."
1, An exceptionally powerful coming-of-age story that pairs the charm and heart we've come to expect from the genre with some especially intense and brutal drama.
1," There are some very good horror moments and nice set-ups, but it's the relationship between Mina and Alex which really centres the film."
0, A kitschy creature-feature that's not as bad as its nonsensical trailer makes it look ... Seeing it in 2-D will save you a few bucks.
0," I can only hope that when the DVD comes out, it includes some hidden camera footage of Harvey Weinstein's immediate reaction when he saw the finished film for the first time and discovered exactly what he wound up paying so much money for."
0," You Are Here is a shockingly inept comedy, a project with the look and style of a mid-'90s Ivan Reitman or Harold Ramis comedy, not the first film from one of our finest TV writers."
0," If liberation is the endgame of ""Fifty Shades Freed,"" most of the time we feel trapped right alongside the characters, immobilized by the pointless, suffocating beauty and the stultifying dramatic inertia of the world James has created for them."
1," The flaws aren't the story with this unusual film. The story is in the powerful, vivid and emotionally draining scenes of torment and conflict between a mother and daughter. "
0," If you're not going to do right by these characters, go give Marvel them back. Why are you still trying to make all this money if you're not doing right by the fans?"
1,So what if The Kings of Summer backs away from greatness and builds itself a little fort in indie comedy central instead? That's not so bad. It's still a pretty neat fort.
0,A monument to cinematic suckiness.
1,It was still fun despite its shortcomings.
1, Reasonably entertaining if utterly familiar.
1," What the movie excels at, among other things, is putting the viewer into the prison life mindset, laying dramatic groundwork that allows the audience to intuit when an unspoken rule-like crossing the prison's strict racial boundaries-has been broken."
0,Done in by a weak script.
0," Clearly inspired thematically by American Beauty, but unable to reach its status or impact."
1," Fascinating but unfocused docu on media, ethics, power. "
1," Three words of advice to those who haven't yet seen it: Run, don't walk."
1, A stunning trifecta of women lead this delectably vicious tale on the gluttony of power. 
0, Its litany of human freaks and animal monstrosities are meant to distract from the superficiality of its psychological and intellectual concerns.
0, Jodie Whittaker's performance humanizes the film's troubled protagonist better than the story.
0," An all style and little substance post-Samurai, Wild West anger mismanagement outing, with Tarantino as a varmint spouting Japanese while boasting an impressive knack for shooting snakes, and eating their hearts out."
0," I've you've seen Eli Roth's Cabin Fever, there's no need to watch this 2016 remake. If you HAVEN'T seen Roth's Cabin Fever, start there, and re-read my previous sentence."
0," [A] well-meaning, misbegotten movie."
1,Rourke's greatest achievement is the performances she's coaxed out of her two lead actresses. They're so good they're like De Niro and Pacino in Heat. 
0,"It doesn't work as a science fiction epic, it doesn't work as a tale of families bonding in the face of tragedy, and it certainly doesn't work as a mingling of the two."
1, A tour de force in the blending and bending of genres.
0, A pretty listless satire of workplace culture.
1," The sex in Fat Girl is ... an all-consuming, character-defining process of sorting through emotions and attitudes that convincingly perplexes these girls."
1, This film's greatest achievement was in showcasing dignity.
1, A truly absorbing and enjoyable film.
1, Coco's sincerity is undeniable and its creativity often remarkable. The songs might be unlikely earworms but the film easily earns its place in your heart.
1, A moving tribute to a community rallying together to overcome tragedy.
0, Seldom have I seen a movie so adamantly opposed to nuance. 
0," Dialogue howlers and largely soapy, melodramatic performances abound."
0, Almost interesting at best and terribly redundant at worst.
0," Aspiring Hollywood filmmakers, take note. If you want to get a movie produced with minimal creative effort, Richard Loncraine and Joe Forte have provided the perfect template with Firewall."
0,Soft-core cornography.
1," Quickly and assuredly, writer-director Carbone puts us in the mood of these languorous summer days."
0,"The film itself just isn't very engaging, in part because Portman is so frustratingly passive for much of it."
0," Kebbell portrays Doom not as a dictator with supreme technical and sorcerous powers, but a video game playing beardo with daddy issues (to be fair, they all have daddy issues)."
1," For those craving a large helping of nostalgia with a topping of crowd-pleasing patriotism, there are few choices better than The Majestic."
1," At the very least, it will send many viewers back to the recordings, some of them superior to the renditions heard here, with a more vivid picture of the extraordinary woman who made them."
1, Black's performance carries the movie.
0," ""Broken City""? More like ""Broken Movie."""
1, Cotillard doesn't fear embracing the worst aspects of the character. [Full review in Portuguese.]
0," It's obnoxious, derivative, and ultimately an empty experience."
0," Admittedly I'm not the target audience, but this heavy-handed tale of cute 'n' spunky young Miley getting back to her rural roots is tough to swallow."
1, Italian writer-director Alice Rohrwacher captures a conflicted 12-year-old girl's summer straddling childhood and maturity in The Wonders.
0," Attempting to capture this woman's perennially sozzled state in visual terms, Taylor lets the camera wobble to and fro, punctuates the story with jarring cuts to black, and resorts to slow-motion with amateurish abandon."
0, It's a gender-role tantrum rather than an exploration of gender-role consciousness.
0," I expected dumb. An incomprehensible mess punctuated with cheese-encrusted CGI effects, phony philosophizing and outbursts of tedium, I did not. "
0," The performances and the inherent power of the true story keep it from being a complete disaster, but one hopes Serkis moves on to more challenging material with his follow-up."
0, It isn't entirely clear what Stephen Gyllenhaal sees in the material apart from some lukewarm raging against the machine.
0,"This animated adaptation of the Japanese comics characters and concepts appears to have been cobbled together from parts of other, better movies."
0,"Jack Goes Boating is extremely well-acted and full of moments I adored, it's just the final product itself that sadly left me cold."
0, Don't bother travelling to your cinema to see it.
0, It's a rare comedy that is so painfully unfunny that it earns not a single laugh.
1," Gloriously bonkers, with a charming central performance from Elle Fanning."
1, If you're under the age of 60 Teflon is in your bloodstream. This is a well documented fact that... Dupont and 3M acknowledge in documents and - when pressed - under oath.
0, A relentlessly-offensive bottom-feeder of no redeeming social value which I learned in law school is the Supreme Court's definition of obscene. 
0, The film just glumly proceeds.
1," Don't expect anything resembling believability, but enjoy the blend of strikingly colorful visuals and banter between odd couple Johnson and Caine, which combine for a mild escapist treat."
0,"Despite Jones' performance, it's a disappointing biopic"
1, Saoirse Ronan creates an unforgettable character. [Full review in Spanish]
1," Hoffman brings a sympathetic touch to a small dramatic piece that recalls the warm-hearted ""little people"" dramas of the '50s."
1, It ends up staying with you long after the jittery animated images have faded from the screen.
1," This riveting, dismaying documentary is that cinematic car accident you can't take your eyes from."
0," Marginally fascinating and well-edited, but has too much potatoes and not nearly enough meat for audiences hungry for insight about the second Golden Age of Animation."
1," An exquisitely realized work; the filmmakers' technical mastery of their craft, always impressive, has become absolute."
1," Godard's utterly nonlinear drama explores history and memory, old age and youth, love and art, action and reaction, life and existence, and possibly even more ideas than I was unable to mine in one exhaustive viewing."
0," She is supposed to be a self-pitying near alcoholic who can't take control of her own life. Hathaway, though, is such a strong screen presence that it's hard to believe in her as such a weak and needy type."
0," Bohemian Rhapsody is bad in the way a lot of biopics are bad: it's superficial, it avoids complexity, and the narrative has a connect-the-dots quality."
1, The final moments of Bad Hair are as fiercely emotive as Truffaut's fabled still-shot ending for 400 Blows. This is grand cinema.
1," There's no important message here, no contemporary re-working of an ancient classic. This, folks, is film-making that aims for nothing more profound than the funny bone. This, folks, in all its glory, is frivolous comedy."
1, Does it live up to the hype? Hell yeah!
0, How do you know you've got a dud? When a cast this talented and determined can't lift a soporific screenplay to entertaining heights.
1,"Russell has always had a talent for harmonizing tragedy and comedy, seriousness and outlandishness, all within a precise tone that allows for a wide range of emotions and effects. But his hand has never been more sure."
0, An entertaining genre piece boasting a terrifically sinewy lead performance from Wanda De Jesus.
1," Fans will get it, the rest of you will not, and that's been the nature of the series since ""The Two Towers."" Jackson has always been respectful of the text, perhaps to a fault."
1," Structurally, ""The Wonders"" suffers from awkward bulges and sags, especially toward the end. Still, it's a beautiful, richly imagined ride that doesn't end as much as evaporate into a dreamlike puff of smoke."
1, The quintessential Lynch. Prepare to be confused/ intrigued/ frustrated/ disturbed/ hooked.
1," Ricki raises smart questions about why a mother's musical ambitions are so much more selfish than, say, seven-time dad Mick Jagger's, and even the shamelessly corny sing-along finale wrings a few real tears out."
1, The beauty of the film is the way it elevates John Malkovich from an actor to an axiom.
0, If you recognize Zeus (the dog from Snatch) it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one.
0, A one-sided document of a clear blowhard with some interviews of South American leaders on the side.
1," ...whitewashed to only put the best face forward. Although there's plenty of song, these five guys travel the world with no wine and no women except their moms (Taylor Swift, briefly attached to heartthrob Harry, has been excised)."
1,...virtually every single scene is interesting on a purely visceral level.
1," The Mamma Mia universe exists outside the dichotomy of ""good"" and ""bad."" It exists outside of space and time. It doesn't know sense or logic; only joy, love, and ABBA."
0," The funny thing is that Gyllenhaal, with his boyish charm playing nicely off his buffed-up physique, actually makes a pretty decent action hero. If only we could go back in time and make Prince of Persia worthy of him."
1," Its virtues are understated, powerful, genuine."
0, [The] direction is so unassured and nervous that it feels like he second guessed every choice in the film.
1," Arguably, it's a bit too cool for school sometimes, and it is self-conscious. But these are byproducts of its undoubted confidence at carrying off a visually distinctive, witty, autobiographical comedy."
0," To his credit, director-writer Mike Leigh doesn't inject any moral high ground on a subject that could easily feel one-sided. But he doesn't give Staunton a full range of material to work with either."
1, Sublime. I loved it. And I'll love it when I see it again. 
0, The First Wives Club has a stellar ensemble cast and wastes them on a story that seems -- for lack of a better description -- so Eighties in its excess.
0," For the life of me, I'm sitting here at my computer trying to figure what all the fuss was about."
0, The script feels as if it started to explore the obvious voyeuristic potential of 'hypertime' but then backed off when the producers saw the grosses for Spy Kids.
1," Rude, crafty, funny and richly profane, it's the work of an artist unmistakably in his element."
0, Not so much bad as it is unnecessary.
1,"Crowe, who aims high to plant a big smile on your face, does so here more than competently."
1," This big, silly action movie, spawned of Jaws and Sharknado, is a kick to watch, mainly because the makers of this film seem to be having a lot of fun not taking anything seriously. It has a good blend of spectacle and humor."
0," A staid documentary about teaching below the college level marred by incessant, unnecessary music in the soundtrack and by conventional direction."
1, Armando Iannucci pulls off a balancing act that's more remarkable the more you think about it: this is a movie that's both mercilessly grim and uproariously funny.
0," It's just a thinly written VH1-style sketchbook of a movie - which is to say, it's a Netflix film, with zero atmosphere, overly blunt lighting, and a threadbare post-psychological telegraphed quality that gives you nothing to read between the lines."
1, ...cleverly always keeps fear somewhere in the frame.
1," Watch Tanu Weds Manu Returns if you love Bollywood. Watch it if you follow Bollywood. And if you look down upon Bollywood, watch the movie to see how entertaining the industry can be."
0," Man, I've seen the whole Johnny English trilogy and don't remember a g--d--- thing about it."
1,An imaginatively twisted lesson in film history and a glorious gothic comedy-drama.
1,An enjoyably inventive low-budget B-movie filled with action and interesting characters.
1," Packages a real-life story of athletic triumph and social progress into an accessible, rousing melodrama that is no less potent for being almost entirely predictable."
1," Every aspect of the film seeks to make an emotional connection with the audience via specificity, and thanks to masterful work from Lonergan as writer and director and phenomenal performances from the entire ensemble cast, it is an absolute triumph."
0," Though the film benefits from an easy chemistry between the leads, it never hits any of the highs hinted at early on, leaving audiences unfulfilled by the possibility of what might have been."
1," [Malick's] characters must consider their lives, consider each other, and resolve the situation like adults. And when they do, a story that seemed to be irredeemably broken snaps back together."
0," Neeson's Jason Statham-ization continues apace, but it's looking less and less like a welcome development."
0," Having already paid for itself with corporate pounds of flesh and not bothered forwarding the cash to buy a laugh or two, The Internship is happy to take your money and dismiss you with a Google Wave."
0, The film works well as a conventional tear-jerker drama told in a straightforward no-nonsense manner.
0," For the most part, though, things play out like horror-movie bingo."
1," What's interesting about the reserved, delicate Strayed is that it's satisfied to imply its themes rather than spell them out for us."
1," ""A topic as sexy as money should never, ever be boring."""
0," The effects are the usual Cheez Whiz with the exception of a scene in which Ravenna suddenly transforms into what's poetically known as ""an unkindness of ravens"" and one in which she takes a dip in a milky pool and emerges a vanilla-coated Venus. OK, wow."
0, Feels like it stepped in dog doo-doo but doesn't know it.
1," Buried is completely and utterly, 100 percent dedicated to bringing you all the Ryan-Reynolds-nailed-in-a-coffin action you could ever ask for. "
1," The low budget hasn't prevented the filmmakers from taking care with details. The film's almost palpable: You feel the coldness of the blue, forbidding sky and smell the bristling dustiness of the harvest-ready wheat."
1, It's a bizarre and surprisingly clever concept that really makes the most of it for a lot of laughs.
1," Ralph Breaks The Internet still rates as a triumphant return for a beloved set of characters that will charm, exhilarate and wildly entertain on its own terms."
1," Jack will always be a force of nature with a Cheshire cat grin. But this time, he is eclipsed by the incredible lightness of Keaton."
0, Katniss' concern for the anti-sexy Peeta results in her spending quite a bit of the movie in po-faced mopery.
1," Luckily, some cliches die hard!"
0, You never sense that any of the players is inhabiting a character. Instead they seem to be dispiritedly reading lines off of an internal teleprompter ...
0, A well-meaning yet disjointed effort that often seems more like a crusader's travelogue than documentary.
1,The movie is all about the set-up - something that becomes a crutch disguised as a narrative tic as the story unfolds. 
1," Only Christopher Walken comes close in terms of sheer, genius weird, but here it's hardly even a near miss, not even with a Louisville Slugger. [Nicholas] Cage owns this film, dead babies, ruinous chaos, and all."
1," To tell a tale, of epic scale, with Ridley Scott again. And if you should moan, he'll beat you with a phone. Russell Crowe. Russell Crowe. Russell Crooowe."
0," Director Nesher has a way of reducing each confrontation to its two-dimensional essence, and he's not helped by a swampy, sentimental musical score."
1," Jihadism is perpetually ablaze in the news, but the Mauritanian movie Timbuktu, a nominee for the best foreign film Oscar, gives those who suffer its condemnations a searingly human face."
1," Those who watch the whole film will not only find it informative, enlightening and time well spent. They will also agree it cannot and will not incentivise any viewer to go out and get themselves an eating disorder."
1, This movie is the epitome of dumb fun.
0, It sounds more like a threat than a promise.
1,"Whatever problems some might have with its execution, it's hard to argue against a film whose intent is to kindle youthful compassion for living things and inspire action to protect Earth and its creatures."
0,"Whatever the rationale behind it, the flippancy of McDonagh's compulsive jokes frequently halts the momentum of a film that is about how flippancy is an inadequate response to the horrors of the world."
0, It's not bad -- simply unremarkable.
1, Another don't-miss gem from DreamWorks.
0," I have no idea why, whenever a studio decides to do a big musical, they never actually hire singers to act in the films"
0, I remain skeptical about the ability of even the best American actors to read Shakespeare's lines without giving the impression that they are enduring very painful cultural root canal work.
0, A smarmy premise becomes an unspeakably offensive movie in a mess that is not just disgusting but dull. I don't need a bath after seeing it; I need an exorcism.
1," It would be interesting to pair this well-reviewed 'art' film with 'Make Them Die Slowly' or another of the usually reviled Italian jungle-atrocity movies that covered similar ground, literally (dense tropical forest) and incidentally."
1," 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' may be the purest distillation of Anderson's specific, inimitable style."
0," Peter Jackson didn't particularly want to direct The Hobbit, and I didn't particularly want to be bored to tears, but there we both were, fulfilling what could only be described as some sort of cinematic murder-suicide pact."
1," ""The One I Love"" is diverting, but nothing catches fire, despite Ms. Moss, an amazing actress fast breaking free of the limits imposed on her by ""Mad Men."""
0," All the sensuality, all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been, pardon the pun, sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness."
1," Though it doesn't fully resonate as a romance, it is effective as a character study."
0, Glass is more interested in having the characters from its two predecessor films meet and confront each other than in actually having anything happen when they do.
1," As far as date night movies go, you could do far worse than the raunchy yet sweet Sex Tape, featuring solid comedic turns from Cameron Diaz, Jason Segel, and Rob Lowe."
0," It's increasingly clear that we're meant to read this at face value as a tale of people swept away by passion. Which is a problem, because on that level much of this is a ham-fisted (or should that be peach-fisted) mess. "
1," Within the confines of this cross-cultural shaggy-dog tale, Hirayanagi locates both a sharp vein of absurdist comedy and a bitter, melancholy undertow."
1," In the end, star charisma and Liman's style win us over and we relax into a sophisticated summertime diversion that is noticeably intended for adults."
1, The combination of professional actors and locals is effective and adds to the unique telling of this immigrant story.
0, Atmospheric but pedestrian.
1," Ruben Östlund's The Square is a much more goofier affair, an entertaining but episodic satire on the pretentious nature of the modern art industry."
1, Cooke crams in so much persuasively appalling information ... that it's easy to forgive him for seemingly trying to push all viewers' proverbial buttons at once.
0," [Year One] feels lazy: There's no cheap joke Mr. Ramis and company didn't go for, no gag-worthy gag they didn't include."
1," Dark Shadows is a bit of a slow burn, but once it gets going, it's good."
1, Light hearted and fun!
1,"If you are sans children, you may feel a little awkward walking in, but once the movie starts, you'll feel right at home."
0," Mortensen and Ali are a joy to watch, but Green Book is just a warm bath of clichés."
1, A visual treat that should remind audiences just why they love to see summer blockbusters - because every now and then they are both enjoyable and well-made films.
1," A sparkling contraption of an animated comedy, funny and often wondrous in its midcentury-modern vision of an alternate America frozen in the amber of a bygone idealism."
0, I just did not get pulled in.
0, About as far from 'super' as a comedy can get.
0," '71 takes an ethno-nationalist conflict rooted in hundreds of years of colonialist history and makes it beige, apolitical and gutless."
0," It'd be nice to say that Hardy, a fine actor, is actually given a chance to act. But he's basically just a Looney-Tunes punching bag."
1," The film reminds us of a tactile, cut-and-paste subculture that's still alive and well in the internet age."
1, It's a gem to savor.
1," A sincere, refreshingly unaffected look at teenagers and their attitudes about the future."
0," My Little Pony: The Movie may not be terrible, but it simply has no compelling reason - beyond more sparkly, rainbow-coloured merchandising tie-ins - for this leap onto the big screen."
1,"An effective, naive and entertaining family movie, which should serve to introduce these endearing characters to those who haven't met them yet. [Full review in Spanish]"
1, Director Alex Gibney methodically pieces together extensive interviews with those who were once senior members of the church to get to the bottom of the group's modus operandi.
1,"A deft treatment of its delicate subject material and some remarkable performances that give the film both touching, raw, authentic emotion and a certain kinetic humor."
1," God bless Steven Spielberg, who knows how to push my buttons."
0," Might've reached a more fulfilling creative explosion with someone else in the lead role, though it would difficult for anyone to shine in a feature that would prefer ingesting poop to exploring the nuances of a sexual awakening."
1," As we peek into the day to day existence of a family stuck in an apartment in the middle of war torn Syria, we see how communities come together, fall apart and witness the resilience of the human spirit."
1,"Like the speedy vehicles that can be seen throughout the film, ""Spy Kids"" moves at an agreeably quick pace, never letting up for such petty things as catching your breath."
1," What lifts Joe above similar stories, besides the acting, is Green's intense attentiveness to setting and atmosphere."
0,"Depp's character is an uneasy blend of hammy matinee idol and Clouseau-like farceur, while Jolie is in the running for the most annoying and insipid ice maiden in cinema history."
1," It has a lot to gnaw on, but it's worth gnawing on."
1," Critics were snotty in 2012 when Cruise first played Reacher, because the 5'7"" actor is not the six-five, 250-pound bruiser of Lee Child's novels. Get over it. The admirably defiant star brings his own agility and quick wit to the role. "
0, Some movies go off on tangents. This movie is nothing but tangents.
1,"A literate, lyrical love story in the age of Hollywood crass. I must be dreaming."
1," Instinct, by trusting its own, should manage to sate a few common urges of moviegoers of all type."
1," An impressionistic, poetic cosmic journey that asks far more questions than it answers, many of them in Malick's by now familiar quasi-religious rhetorical style."
1, Ghost is a dazzlingly enjoyable pop thriller.
0," Aside from a few neat flourishes, this is attention-sapping stuff, lacking texture in both its visuals and vocal performances."
1, One of the better examples of the goofy live-action comic book that's come around recently.
0, A mindless but watchable fondue pot of high-calorie visuals and ready-made plotting ...
1," A brawny, inventive action romp that's as happy firing rockets at helicopters as it is contemplating the Cartesian model of mind-body dualism."
1,A feast for the eyes and ears.
1," An oppressive, claustrophobic and occasionally shocking feminist tale that's just as much about a young girl coming of age in a fundamental Christian household as it is wicked, broomstick-riding evil lurking in the woods."
0," There are undoubtedly four or five one-liners that will have you in stitches, but given the scattergun approach to jokes, that makes for a rather minuscule percentage. "
1,"An intriguing, sensual whodunit that would have been even better had it not succumb to political correctness and changed the identity of the killer from Crichton's novel."
1," I've always wondered how people in horror flicks make such terminally stupid decisions... and where the old coot predicting doom gets his information. This movie answers, in a freaky-gory manner so far off-the-wall that it could be a coffee table."
1," On the surface it's the story of one particular hockey player, but it reflects so much more."
0," Is ""Game of Shadows"" the most pandering picture of the year? Fo' shizzle, Sherlock."
0," The action sequences are okay, but there are so many plot holes that the whole thing is ruined from the end of the bridge sequence."
1," Like an angry tenant bent on revenge, the movie industry has depicted the destruction of Los Angeles with staggering consistency if not a wealth of imagination."
0," I've got some real affection for House of Wax and perhaps that, more than anything, is why I wish it were just a tiny bit better."
0, These characters are so paper-thin it's surprising they even have names.
0, Its subjects blandly keep your attention in almost the exact same way that reality-show contestants keep your attention.
0, A stale re-launch. 
0," It's being sold as a massively scary movie, but all that's really scary is that a talented cast -- which also includes Judy Greer, Brendan Gleeson and Adrien Brody -- could be lulled into thinking Shyamalan's script was anything but obvious nonsense."
1," Holding its poker face to the bitter end, this is a black comedy whose slow burn nonetheless eventually leaves no one unconsumed by the flame of cruel fate."
1," There hasn't been a mainstream movie since maybe ""The Crying Game"" that has so subtly brought up the possibility of a man's bisexuality than ""Humpday."""
1," I've said it before and hope to again: David Cronenberg is the most provocative, original, and consistently excellent North American director of his generation."
1," Gru is a wonderful creation, the animation is consistently stylish, and those little Gru helpers provide plenty of amusement as well."
1, Newman is strength of fine character study
0,"Despite an admirable effort on the part of its creative team, this new technological thriller is at odds with itself from the very first moments."
0," Despite a first reel entirely devoted to establishing characters, Cloverfield is basically a line-'em-up, pick-'em-off horror movie that's effective without being either viscerally frightening or emotionally moving."
1," If you do watch -- and you certainly should -- you will see one of the most remarkable performances ever set to film, given by Gabourey ""Gabby"" Sidibe."
0,"Little about the storytelling suggests a beating heart beneath the visuals; once the journey has begun, the characters find themselves in life-threatening danger with stupefying regularity."
0," You can just picture the meeting: A few guys in Prada suits sit around an L.A. boardroom table going, 'The Matrix meets The Exorcist, huh . . .? With Keanu? I like it. No wait - I love it.'"
0, Scary Movie 3 starts out so funny you'll be wishing you'd brought a respitory assistance apparatus... but then it continues.
0," Unless you're a loyal Hart fan, his latest concert film won't bowl you over."
0," The team has come up with a psychologically realistic but polite work that, like the corsets around Lizzie's torso, feels too buttoned-down and joyless for its own good."
0,"It's not a bad film, per se, but it's more adequate than entertaining, more routine than recommendable."
0, A biopic in which the star transcends himself but is badly let down by the storytelling.
1," For a movie with an all-action style, there's a little more down time than you'd expect but both sci-fi and gore fans should easily get their fix."
0," While Jar Jar Binks is thankfully nowhere to be found, the battle droids prove to be every bit as idiotic and insufferable -- and there are lots of them in the movie."
0," Neither satire nor drama but a sort of stream-of-consciousness rumination on Bush past and present, Stone's film is little better than a stunt, and a fairly toothless one at that."
1," Echoes of War may not be the most dazzling movie of its kind ever made, but the solid acting and engaging ideas make it worth seeing."
1, How did we make sense of the film before? 
1," Strong performances propel a movie that wears its influences (De Palma, Lynch) on its sleeve without feeling like a copycat."
0," Just like Sean, Papi Chulo's heart is clearly in the right place but, just like Sean, it has very little regard for Ernesto's feelings and needs."
1, [T]here's... an oddly poignant attempt to redeem a hackneyed genre from pointless insensitivity.
1,"A wildly entertaining sci-fi comedy, a perfect cup of interstellar action-adventure eggnog to compliment the serious Yuletide films."
1," A shocking 180-degree turnaround from its atrocious predecessor, 'Out of the Shadows' is exactly the movie you wanted two years ago. "
0, Good for Reese Witherspoon and Sofia Vergara for becoming close friends and partners in crime during filming. But there's no need for you to be handcuffed to this mess too. 
1," The web-slinger's latest big-screen outing is fresh, funny and fairly exciting."
1, What emerges is a toxic fairytale about the beauty of artistic endeavour and the beastly behaviour that sometimes accompanies it.
0, Suffers from a flat script and a low budget.
0," Rather than being Stranger Than Fiction with insightful gender politics, Ruby Sparks is more a hipster Weird Science."
0," The scandal of Antichrist is not that it is grisly or upsetting but that it is so ponderous, so conceptually thin and so dull."
0," Fey and Poehler want to show that women can behave as badly as men, but in a way that never compromises their essential niceness. It's possible to have both, but in this movie, it feels too much like pulled punches."
1,Battle Royale is The Hunger Games not diluted for young audiences.
1," It's most towering accomplishment are its set pieces, which manage to be brash, exhilarating, and even occasionally moving."
1, [It] shines a harsh light on the lengths the energy industry continues to go to in order to head off climate-related legislation-and assure the public there's nothing wrong with continuing to rely on fossil fuels.
1," Zellweger saves the day, even when she's just going through the motions."
1,Both an inspirational sports movie and an unexpected multi-level urban drama that plays by its own clock.
0, The anguish of the lovers' decade-long separation can't be evoked in a matter of minutes ...
0, The film's special success resides in the women's hairdos.
1, Call it corny if you like -- and many will -- but Ross sees this biography ... as a chance to make a statement about the country's resilient spirit.
1, Serves as a reminder of all the amazing things American independent cinema could be if it pushed itself more.
0, Not as scary as the orginal shortfilm. [Full review in Spanish]
0," You've seen all this before, so much so that very little of it results in the actual jump-out-of-your-seat shocks that peppered the previous five films."
0," [DMX] acts like he raps -- in fits and starts, with heaps of ruff growling. Li barely has enough lines to qualify for a SAG card."
1,A delightful family-friendly holiday confection.
1," Happy Death Day was like Groundhog Day reimagined as a slasher flick. The sequel, Happy Death Day 2U, is like Back to the Future Part II reimagined the same way."
0," Little movie, called Jack and Diane. Must have been sitting too long in the can. No, it doesn't have the Mellencamp song. And it gets everything thing else terribly wrong."
1, A slyly macabre fantasia that works on its own demented terms.
1," A scene in which an Escobar confidant happens upon Mazur and his wife enjoying an anniversary dinner...morphs into the most unnerving restaurant run-in since Joe Pesci asked Ray Liotta, ""What do you mean I'm funny?"" in Goodfellas."
0," Ditching the hangovers, the backward structure, the fleshed-out characters and any sense of debauchery or fun, this installment instead just thrusts its long-suffering protagonists into a rote chase narrative ..."
1," All of [the actors] are still more than up to the challenge and selling even the most ludicrous scene imaginable, making maudlin bits of melodrama feel far more authentic and genuine than they have any right to be."
1," The movie is more a collection of cool people telling great stories than it is a structured documentary (despite Camalier's attempts in that direction). But in this case, that's enough."
0, I can see why director Tony Goldwyn has been drawn to the story for over a decade. I'm just not sure the end result completely works.
1, Pulls off its biggest emotional beats in the same way that the boys got their biggest laughs -- by basing them more on character than on empty mechanics. 
0, The Commuter forfeits a good movie about why an everyman might get ensnared in some lite Hitchcockian mishegoss for a mediocre one about how he might weasel his way out of it
0, You expect more from director Michael Apted (Enigma) and screenwriter Nicholas Kazan (Reversal of Fortune) than this cliche pileup.
0," While the end of Burn After Reading dribbles away, we realize that we don't care very much about the characters and their futures."
0," The get-the-President movie, a genre we might term ""POTUS in Peril"", has had a chequered history... but [London Has Fallen] adds almost nothing in the way of innovation or inspiration."
0," Is this really what the audience wants? A deliriously unhinged setup and larger-than-life characters, abruptly devolving into a mind-numbingly familiar story with a totalitarian happy ending?"
0," It is, more, an embarrassment to the genre of R-rated comedy."
1, To see the swing of the axe as cleansing rather than grotesque was the last thing I expected. And I'm grateful for it.
1," The film provides nothing particularly fresh, but provides it well."
1, Polanski's eminently suave town-car thriller relaxes willing viewers right into the director's velvet grip.
0," Lizzy Caplan and Alison Brie lend the lightweight rom-com ""Save the Date"" more than its fair share of watchability. But the film is never truly interesting."
1," Staged or not, Cohen still displays a fearlessness and commitment to character unparalleled in the comedy world today."
1," Selick creates a visual wonderland, with a timeless animation style that will make this a favorite for repeat viewings."
0," A long, slow-moving, unthrilling thriller about a teacher who decides to help his wife, unjustly convicted of murder, escape from prison."
0, I think that's what's wrong with this. The minor characters don't emerge from this at all. I'm hard pressed to discern one from the other. 
1," It has the strength of its convictions, with Scorsese's faith in the material sustaining the film's soul even when its cinematic flesh is weak."
0, I was really disappointed.
1, Isn't it finally Tom's turn for an Oscar?
1, Parental Content Review
1," True Grit is a gorgeously shot, well-acted Western that resonates more the more you let it settle."
1, The movie has many human qualities and contains what will be remembered as one of Pacino's finest scenes.
1," A bizarre action thriller, it has a good beginning, a decent but unbelievable middle, and a last reel that's so weird and risible that the audience begins laughing out of embarrassment and disbelief."
0," Sienna Miller captures much of Edie's physical manner and some of her voice (though she's nowhere near deep enough), but there's nothing she can do with material that requires her to mope and pout for the bulk of her screen time."
1," As with last year's ""Lights Out,"" [Mr. Sandberg] proves a master of the flash-scare, a nifty choreographer of precipitous timing and striptease visuals. But he's also adroit with more leisurely horrors"
0," Heavy on sight gags, the movie delivers some raunchy laughs, but they arrive so sporadically as to make for a bumpy ride."
0," The obnoxious special effects, the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant, so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy, dopey old Hanna-Barbera charm."
1,"In her American feature debut, a romantic advenure in the Greek Islands, the tall and sexy Sophia Loren starred with the short and declining Alan Ladd."
0," In the end, this is a subject deserving of a clearer focus and greater attention to detail. ""The Promise"" tries its best, but unfortunately misses the mark."
0," At times, the sad sights are enough to make a person hope the put-upon guy finds success. The problem is, as affable as Giovanni is, there's not much more to him."
1," While hardly subtle, honors a man deserving of wider recognition."
0," The Accountant wants to be a thriller, a shoot-'em-up, and a sensitive argument for neurodiversity all at once. What it actually is is stupid."
1," Weiwei doesn't break any new ground in covering the global refugee crisis, but he vividly illustraes - in straightforward yet artistic terms - the scale of the problem without compromising the dignity or humanity of the survivors."
1," The animation is perfectly beautiful, and the sequences with flying origami completely capture the audience's imagination."
1," Fincher handles the violence with sensitivity, announcing its obscenity in spoken analyses and briefly glimpsed post mortem shots, but never showing the murderous acts themselves."
0, Battleship has the IQ of a rutabaga and doesn't require much more intelligence than that to watch.
1,"... sometimes, method acting is its own worst enemy. Theron is very, very good ... but many close-ups seem almost calculated to keep reminding us of just how extraordinarily her appearance has been changed."
0," To end my assessment on the level of the film's writing, you'll wish you never heard about the Morgans. (Ha ha ha)"
1," We're talking instant family classic here, folks."
1," The movie is so fragmented that no real interpretation of the play ever coagulates. As with all of Welles' films, however, there are a number of memorable moments."
0," Liu Ye is too inexpressive for his role's demands, and the movie doesn't build to his downfall: It just zaps itself there."
0," A salacious yet also tedious portrayal of a woman who would appear to confirm all the nastiest stereotypes about women. Completely unfun, unpleasant, unerotic, and unenlightening."
0," This one nevertheless falls short, thanks to the plodding direction of Stuart Hazeldine, who also lets Worthington engage in the kind of mumbling whisper that some actors mistake for intensity."
1," If you're looking for a heartfelt, feel-good holiday movie, just give in and enjoy."
1," There's nothing new here, just a whole lot of the old dependable. The difference is that the old dependable is above average."
1, A spectacular display of monotony.
1,Will the big-screen 'Veronica Mars' leave its devoted Marshmallows hungry for s'more? It's a pretty good bet.
0," In the end, we are left with a dull woman who is surrounded by puppets and voiceless actors covered in prosthetics -- and it's never a good sign when the special effects give more memorable performances than the hero. "
0," No real suspense, and no payoff except for a groan-inducing, look-out-here-comes-the-sequel ending."
1, A very funny comedy that also contains some insights on the spiritual exercise of dealing with difficult people. 
1," The set-pieces feel somewhat expected, thankfully there's still plenty of witty banter and inventive filmmaking touches to keep the audience entertained."
1," The movie wraps itself around you like a pleasurably constricting vise, so that long before its climactic heist ... you find yourself rapt, on the edge of your seat, unable to blink."
1," The theme is something of a self-pitying cliché, and yet Lynch takes such a novel path to it that the film has a hypnotic, transcendent force."
1," [A] gorgeous silent extravaganza, a landmark of Indian cinema."
1," What keeps us hooked is Ronan, a young actress of seemingly limitless abilities, and the tension she creates between Hanna's inhumanly agile body and quizzical eyes, which turn cold only when she pulls the trigger."
0, The first and second half of the film feel disjointed and the soundtrack is jarring - what started off as a really interesting and non linear biopic falls flat.
0," the direction of the film is fraught with problems, and one feels that the promising young cast deserved better than this."
0, Not even Robert Langdon could make sense of this silliness.
1," Departures is a great film and, yes, you're going to need your reading glasses -- this one is subtitled."
0, So white bread and scrubbed clean of any edges that it plays like a Saturday matinee at the cineplex in Pleasantville.
1," Benjamin and Patton have devised a basic Prohibition era gangster story as a background for their newest musical experiment melding modern hip-hop with the jazz and blues of the '30s, all put together with a great deal of visual cleverness and flair."
0," A disaster on a conceptual level, McG's latest is a trainwreck of botched stunts, unfunny gags, and tuneless performances, pieced together with minimal interest in any sort of engaging cinematic clarity. "
1," While ecology and evolution provide loose themes, Björk's impish glee ignites a fabulously off-piste affair."
1," From the opinionated and deliberate young Emily Dickinson to her eventual decision to live as a real-life ""madwoman in the attic,"" it's a haunting portrait of one of America's most celebrated voices. "
1, a soaring vision that appeals to the senses and the spirit
0, The title character is far too good for the movie he inhabits
1, Death Sentence is a better film than many might expect and also delivers several good doses of action for fans of shoot 'em-ups.
1," It's a beautiful, vibrant story about memories, the passing of time and how you treat the people in your life."
1," ""Midnight Family"" channels madness quite vividly, yielding a constantly riveting film that wrings out every kind of emotion."
1," [A] fast-paced thriller [that] won't change your life, but it won't leave you checking your watch every five minutes either."
1," It's well done by the two leads, who register as real enough to rescue the movie at almost every turn from mawkishness and predictability."
0," If it weren't for all that inept banter, this might have been a different film indeed."
0,a picture with a situation instead of a plot
1," Enjoyable, fast-paced comedy-thriller with well written characters, decent chase sequences, a frequently funny script and superb performances from Shepard, Bell and Bradley Cooper."
1," The first half of Michael Bay's new film is a spare, creepy science fiction parable, and then it shifts into a high-tech action picture. Both halves work. Whether they work together is a good question."
1,Chalamet is a revelation.
1," Conjures some spectacular settings and grown-up topics, but has no story to speak of."
0," The real cause of wonder, though, is why Nolan should have embraced technocratic complexity in the service of such a puny story."
1," You bet your ass that Julianne Moore is overdue for Academy love. She's supremely gifted, possessing the beauty of a true star and the intuitive technique of a true actress. "
0, This is the first time I've ever attended a screening where the audience was screaming the word 'edit!'
1," Tony Manero, Vincent Vega, Charlie Wax. Travolta has his franchise now! Gleeful killer Wax makes Bond and Bourne look like clumsy amateurs. Roaring fun."
0," In their religious fidelity to the original, director John Moore and writer David Seltzer don't attempt to paper over anachronisms from Seltzer's 1976 script."
1," Taken as a whole, if you allow yourself to take a leap of faith The Adjustment Bureau is an intriguing, engrossing experience. At the very least, it just might be the perfect date movie."
1," While it may not be a grand comeback vehicle for the so-called 'Muscles From Brussels', the film is his best in quite some time."
1," While not all superhero films are created equal, this comic-book space adventure adaptation is just good enough."
0," Never Been Kissed, like so many coulda-shoulda-woulda-been-good movies, starts out strong. Then it loses its nerve in the third act, substituting a fuzzy emotional spectacle for a coherent conclusion."
1, Devastating postmortem on a dead dot-com.
0," Based on a story by Philip K. Dick, the new idiot-fest known as Impostor is about as entertaining as the second of two bologna sandwiches."
1, Aronofsky explores the quest for perfection in what is a near-perfect film.
0, This is just one of those movies that really shouldn't have been made.
0," Suffers from largely rudderless direction, relying for any sense of profundity on the breathtaking beauty of Abraham Haile Biru's cinematography."
1," Mr. Perlmutt ultimately shows that for these drivers, car culture runs deeper than simply winning or losing a race."
1, Sleight succeeds with its creation of a modern quasi-superhero in Bo and the launching of an electric new leading man in Latimore.
0," Rampant racism, misogyny, and homophobia serve as placeholders where actual jokes might have been, with Jennifer Aniston suffering the worst of it."
0," What begins as a sexually charged, energetic rock love story featuring two actresses pouring their souls into two iconic characters grinds to a halt beyond act one."
0," It's neither great nor horrible, but rather just middle-of-the-road, wrapped in slick production values and featuring an able-bodied, but misguided cast."
0," As Ain't Them Bodies Saints moves along, its elliptical approach to drama goes from keeping us on our toes to dulling everything down."
1," Kaufman's protagonist, as always, is a man trapped in a world where reality has shifted sideways, but which he has come to accept as normal."
0, The collision of violent spasms and art-film ennui leave the viewer's brain bloody but unfilled.
0," Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins feels like a rudimentary retread of previously outrageous ""black attack"" farces... needlessly cluttered, unfocused and pointless..."
1," One of the year's best, an emotionally rich lesbian love story."
1, Some American audiences may reject out of hand a gay-themed tale set in the macho sanctity of the West. But they'd be missing great performances by Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger and an engrossing tribute to the American cowboy tradition.
1,An infectious appreciation for rock and roll lingers past the somewhat self-satisfied finale.
0, You have to wonder why director Gabriele Muccino chose to dramatize the poor man's plight by having him run constantly through the streets of San Francisco. What ever became of quiet desperation?
0," Baaghi borrows heavily from The Karate Kid and Bloodsport. The focus is on action, but occasional songs and melodrama spoil the fun."
1," The formidable running time will doubtless deter many, which is a shame: Winter Sleep is never less than richly engrossing, even if some scenes, stretched too long, take on a didactic, even slightly hectoring tone."
0, This movie must be pretty bad if even a Swedish tanning team can't earn it a good review.
1, Will touch the hearts of anyone-of any age-who can reconnect with the magical childlike power of believing. 
1," An exciting and involving rock music doc, a smart and satisfying look inside that tumultuous world."
0," Visible for miles, the predictable turn of the VHS tape undermines a movie that's already weak in scariness."
1, Not particularly memorable.
0, A lacklustre and cliché-ridden Danish crime sequel.
1," Although I wasn't always blown away by the film and/or its various elements, for the most part I was engaged by the tale. And much of that is due to the presence of and performance by Jennifer Lawrence. (Full Content Parental Review also available)"
1,Who knew that people could love their garbage so much that they grow angry when it is taken from them?
1," The music, supervised by Marcus Mumford and T Bone Burnett, is uniformly elegant and moving."
0,The qualities that have kept the Broadway Fiddler running these seven years are in scant supply onscreen.
1," Director Taika Waititi proves expert in his management of tone, such that the farcical elements, however numerous, don't detract from the very real friendship the renegades develop as they elude the world's most dedicated social services officer."
0," Peploe's smarts and the deft performances can't compensate for the fact that what we're watching, however charming, is a fancifully costumed theater piece that cuts off the oxygen needed to make a play breathe onscreen."
1, Most resounding are the indelible characters created by a wonderful cast.
0, What the movie needs is an element of fun -- or at least childlike wonder -- to balance out the foreboding gloom that hangs over every interaction.
0, The script is so bad and incoherent. [Full Review in Spanish] 
1," I have to say I find the surrealist ending rather flabby and undermining, but this is still a terrific film made with incredible brio."
0, Sinks any chance DC had to compete against Marvel. [Full review in Spanish]
0," ""This Is Where I Leave You"" feels like a social experiment in how much slack we're willing to cut a movie filled with actors we like."
1, It is so frenetic and furiously funny that it's over far too quickly.
0," One of the most confusing, ridiculous, pretentious and disastrous cinematic train wrecks I've ever seen."
0," There are some zippy chase scenes and shootouts, and tension throughout. But the characters - especially the lethargic Affleck - make for more of a C-Team than an A-Team."
0, The usual over-familiar mélange of forensic evidence and titillating torture porn that reminds me why I don't watch network television procedurals. 
1," Intelligent talky fare, beautifully acted, and visualised."
0,"While the movie shines at times, its surprisingly stale storyline keeps it from becoming an instant, stop-motion classic."
1," If you want an hour & forty-five minutes of stylish action & fun chases, & go in expecting a straightforward but entertaining story... you'll get what you want..."
1, Focus is about the sensation of having your wallet lifted by a pickpocket with nimble fingers. And it's skilled enough to earn the viewer's emptier billfold.
1," I'm not quite sure how Rees has done it, exactly, but the depth of heartbreak and humanity in this - just her second feature film - is remarkable."
0, The film's pleasures are to be found almost entirely in the meticulously recreated period design.
0," If you can ignore the tiresome romance and the incessant playing of largely inane music on the soundtrack, Grosse Point Blank has much to recommend it."
1," It's rotten to the core and right down to the end. But if you find that such extremes can be fascinating, then the movie may cheer you, not because it is happy, but because it goes for broke."
0," Sonia is a powerful subject, but ""Big Sonia"" brings little perspective to her story."
1, Tough stuff sensitively delivered via compelling performances.
0," Many kids will enjoy this traditionally animated story, but parents may find it overlong even at a running time of less than 90 minutes."
0," It might have worked better as a documentary, or better yet a paragraph on Wikipedia."
0,"If it were any worse, they'd be screening it as evidence at The Hague."
1, Deeply unsettling and hard to shake.
1, Elle endears herself to us simply because she is so confidently self-assured.
1," In the end, this documentary, which has the mood of a Hollywood thriller, is about a plan that failed...Nothing hurts like failure."
1," If you're looking for a clockwork-perfect crime plot, you won't find it here. But if you want to hang with some wildly unpredictable and complex characters and wonder who will come up on top, ""Hustle"" is a lot of fun."
1," Thankfully never sentimental, and wisely resisting an easy, happy ending, Ilo Ilo is a surprisingly satisfying import."
1, The plotting becomes increasingly contrived and the final reel revelations don't ring true.
0, Message to Hollywood: Stop with the time-travel stuff.
1," Drag's a brief, blunt and utterly brilliant blast of humor, terror and wicked satire; a trifle that feels like triumph, a dashed-off flick that blows doors off big-budget competition, and is about as much fun as you can have at the multiplex."
1, ...a rare film of conflict without villains.
1," Ribald, funny and sometimes sweet, and well acted by Murphy, Lawrence and a strong supporting cast."
0, Boasts as its main selling points a beautiful young starlet with about twenty minutes of screentime and the steadfast promise of an absence of myth and magic.
0," The knee-jerk, or neckless cinematography (in other words, it's all over the place) is horrendous, unprofessional and junkie. A mess. And the two-a-half-hour running time is no less ludicrous and a feat on its own."
0," The kind of Ultra-Lite-Capraesque schmaltz you're supposed to go torpid with at a Sunday matinee, surrounded [by] parents who are probably thanking god that they only have 2.5 kids."
0," This material is probably more suited for a TV miniseries. There is a lot of ground to cover here: 33 miners, lots of family members, a host of government officials and the media-sensation disaster itself."
0, It's a shameful waste of time.
0," There's much to like here but it's a bumpy ride and for all its banter, it takes itself very seriously. "
0," More an accumulation of often indefinable images than any kind of even remotely traditional feature, the documentary ""Leviathan"" proves a strange and unsatisfying endurance test."
1," It blazed a bloody trail for the much-loved slasher cycle, but it also assured us that a B-movie could be A-grade in quality and innovation."
0," In this ditzy whirl nothing is pushed too far -- the bad aren't really bad, they're all sorry. And the assumption that high school is where it all happens is ringingly endorsed."
1, Winter's Bone is the best film of the year.
0, Warm Bodies even suggests that true love can help the right zombie grow a new heart. That's a con job that makes Bodies lukewarm at best. 
1," Yes, you will enjoy Sex and the City -- probably more so if you call things 'fabulous' and have more pairs of shoes than you have fingers."
0," Another ""almost there"" film for Gerard Butler. Amazing that he is still coasting on his ""300"" fame."
1," This is survival, revealed in all the blunt details of a documentary portrait and the simple power of [Michelle] Williams' unadorned, Oscar-worthy performance."
0," Fails to capture either the freewheeling, joyous spirit of the Caribbean or the heady euphoria of blossoming romance."
1," Shelton's comedy isn't just smart, but cheerfully wise; not just funny, but cleverly and endlessly so."
1,Under no circumstances would I call Inherent Vice a bad film. It's too weird and fascinating and filled with too many delightful performances...
0, This comically tasteless and flavorless adaptation of Ayn Rand's bombastic magnum opus delivers her simplistic nostrums with smug self-satisfaction.
1," The film does a pretty good job of escalating the suspense until we get to the payoff scenes. Yaiza Figueroa does a fine job as the film's main character, and writer/director Keir Burrows does a nice job maintaining the mystery and suspense."
1, Viola Davis leads the way with a hurricane performance and everything about Widows is pretty much sensational.
0," A Jaeger bomb, but no worse than its humdrum predecessor."
0," With the domino pieces in place, the plot then coasts along rather predictably."
1, ...boasts a pervasively absurd atmosphere that's heightened on an all-too-frequent basis by the almost uniformly over-the-top performances.
1, [It's] a rousing entertainment with eye candy in abundance. Rules Don't Apply is witty and weird by turns. 
1," [The film impresses] with its painterly and dramatic lighting, beautiful dissolves and tracking shots, sophisticated effects, and unexpected eccentricities."
1," A handsome thriller with plot twists that don't always make sense, ""The Two Faces of January,"" moves slowly, but ultimately entertains."
0," Oh my, what magic Angela Bassett can work!"
0," [It's] like going to the NBA All-Star Game and seeing a fantastic team take the floor, but when the game begins you realize they left their brains in the locker room."
1,"In Japan, the most extreme delicacy goes hand in hand with garishness, and Coppola offers up both for our delectation. It's a heady, hallucinatory combo."
1, Sayles demonstrates a remarkable ability to fully flesh out characters who are on-screen for only a short time.
0, Rarely is a sports movie so inept that it can't even make its central figure likable.
0, It would be nice if movies stopped trying to make young girls aspire to be princesses.
1, Lee has successfully married some of this year's most sumptuous visuals with one of its most compelling and unashamedly spiritual stories.
1, A film that could be a good contender for both an Oscar as well as a Razzie.
1," takes no chances, but what it lacks in originality it makes up for by being so completely enraptured by the music that it takes the audience along with it"
1, You might tag the young writer-director Leslye Headland as someone to watch in the future.
0,"Russell should probably be applauded for trying something different, but I Heart Huckabees often seems weird for weirdness' sake."
0,"If it weren't for Matthew McConaughey's tightly coiled performance, the nasty white-trash drama ""Killer Joe"" wouldn't be worth the powder it would take to blow it to hell."
0, The film's points are made obvious the first minute and then monotonously drilled ad nauseum the remaining 87.
1,David Twohy's programmatic vacation thriller A Perfect Getaway is silly and fun and while it has its annoyingly meta moments it certainly won't leave you bored.
0, Five seconds: That's the maximum length of any uninterrupted shot in McG's action thriller 3 Days to Kill. Call it filmmaking for the Adderall Generation.
1," [Jones] is utterly unconventional and totally alluring. In a remarkable documentary, ""Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami,"" director and editor Sophie Fiennes reveals her subject's essence in performances and personal moments."
0, Well-intentioned film about the 1969 Stonewall riots is reductive and adds no new insights.
1," Bully is repetitive and not especially artful, but children who allow themselves to see the world through the eyes of the film's victims will never be the same."
0, Fitfully engaging but half-baked.
0, Reveal too much and you've done all the heavy lifting for the audience. Reveal too little and they're left scratching their heads. The Woman in the Fifth will leave you very itchy indeed.
1,"At times the structure labours, but ultimately Fanboys rises above routine Hollywood fare because it never makes fun of the people it represents."
0, Roy Scheider is the only redeeming quality of this sequel.
1," ...less than the sum of its parts, [but] some of those parts are wonderful."
1, dropping it into the January frame might have been the best thing for this film
1, The film ultimately succeeds in offering a fresh female-centered perspective on its genre material. 
1,Excruciatingly intense and prone to explosions of violence.
1," It's handsome, elegantly executed, a little muffled; only Tang, as the lonely accountant, and Chan, as the frantic hustler, give the story some emotional intensity and weight."
1, A brilliantly-realized successor to a solid franchise reboot.
1,"With the book by Hodges and now this film by Tyldum, hopefully Alan Turing will receive the recognition he was so wrongly denied. "
1," Beautifully acted, if a little overcooked."
1, It's a simple story on paper but Anomalisa is a great conversation generator. I'm still reflecting on its style and themes. 
1,"Played with great magnetism and triumphant bluster by Liam Neeson, the film's Michael Collins easily lives up to his nickname."
0," Remarkably good performances by the supporting cast give this beauty-and-the-beast romantic comedy some laughs and warmth, but finding chemistry between the leads proves out of its league."
0," You can empathize with their pain - or at least you can imagine it - but these are not performances that do justice to the couple's shifting disbelief, grief and sense of self."
0," Any suggestion that M. Night Shyamalan is experiencing a career renaissance can be put aside halfway through the movie, when his worst tendencies begin to show through."
0, Writer/director Michael McCullers... pacing is poor and he doesn't know how to showcase the small-screen chemistry of Fey and Poehler on the big screen.
1," ""Goodbye Christopher Robin"" touches something bigger than its own ambitions. It touches, in a way movies rarely do, on some essential current of life."
0," Nothing much happens, and that's the point, but all this wheel spinning could have used more grease."
0," Muddled, aimless, indecipherable, and shallow, Terence Malick's Knight of Cups is one of the most insufferable slogs in recent cinema."
0," Certainly defies logic, but does find a way to hook the audience into wondering how this whole massive scheme is going to end. "
1, An English cousin to the earlier Jamaica-set films The Harder They Come and Rockers that is vastly superior in cinematic terms and just as valuable as a cultural document.
0, Is it sci-fi? Fantasy? Idiocy? Mostly it's a droning mess -- pretty to look at but confounding to the point where you just don't care any more.
0,A multiplex trip that's only slightly less annoying than a case of Montezuma's revenge.
1," ... THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN does it all, and it does it very, very well."
0, A fairly straightforward retelling of the Noah's Ark tale ... lacking one important aspect of any comedy -- funny jokes.
1," Avengers: Infinity War is like a Thanksgiving feast for Marvel fans. It's the characters we love in action together on a scale we've never seen before. But as a complete experience in and of itself, it just isn't."
0, Labor Day could have been a beautiful love story. It also could have been a tense thriller. Trying to be both makes it tonally tricky and not an easy movie to love.
0, For every sequence involving Lino's parkour skills ... there are at least two setpieces that are rather nondescript.
0, Bad history. Bad science. Bad acting. Bad movie.
0, The bulk of the three-hour epic is third-rate schmaltz that pays only lip service to history.
0," By design, the film is intensely preachy. And this preachiness serves a therapeutic purpose, offering jolting possibilities for empathy."
0,"If Rashomon were filmed through a shampoo bottle, you'd have some idea what to expect from the surprisingly mean-spirited comedy, One Night at McCool's."
1," An extraordinary thriller about matters of scholarship and the heart, about the true authorship of a mathematical proof and the passions that coil around it."
0," The movie has plenty of high-tech power, spinning out action so explosive you'll hardly notice how preposterous the story is or how cardboard-thin the characters are."
0, Here it is. The one you've been asking for. Unfortunately that doesn't mean what you're getting will be good or even what you wanted.
0," In the real world, concerts build to a climax, then return for two or three more; on the screen, alas, ""Metallica: Through the Never"" just kind of peters out."
0," 'Aunque puede parecer bastante obvio y bobo para muchos, por lo menos representa un buen rato de entretenimiento puro y sin complicaciones'"
0," This all might make 'Gods of Egypt' sound like a blast, but it's too cramped and muddled to achieve true bad movie transcendence. In other words, it's no ""Jupiter Ascending."""
1," Writer-director Marielle Heller never passes judgement on her characters, giving us an honestly messy account of her heroine's sexual and artistic awakening."
0,"Ziyi is radiant, as real as the script allows -- just not Japanese. Sweetly shot overall, though a dismal mood dominates. Otherwise somewhat simple and soapy."
1," Audrey Tautou's puppy dog eyes and other exaggerated facial expressions do manage to charm you, no matter how calculated they are."
0," Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales doesn't make much sense, and when it does, it's yo-ho-ho and a bottle of dumb."
1," At its best, she wills ""Adrift"" into a moving story about a natural born wanderer who needs an anchor to know her own strength."
0, A script portraying just about every sports fan and ball player as a jerk can hardly justify its feel-good ending.
0," When Taylor Sheridan is left to his own devices, his work seems more abrupt and shallow, no more so than when he resolves all of this film's lingering questions in one unremittingly nasty sideswipe of a flashback. "
0, Gives you more reason than ever to love Black's death scene in 1997's The Jackal.
0," Charming and beautiful looking, but just another mode of transportation for a stubborn old guy lurching through a series of unscheduled stops while finally learning to live."
1, A soap redeemed by an astonishing performance by Sean Penn as a mentally challenged adult seeking custody of his 7-year-old daughter.
0,"Despite solid backup from the ever-formidable Gene Hackman and others, this routine hiatus schedule-filler proves to be a shaky platform from which to launch the likable Romano's candidacy as a big-screen leading man."
0," It would be one thing if it didn't make sense and was funny, but there isn't one second of entertainment for anyone that doesn't require a drool bib."
0," There's a detached sense of boredom in Mascots, as if [Christopher] Guest himself is tired of his schtick."
0," While frantic and familiar, it's an 88-minute, family-friendly diversion that should have a longer life on video shelves than in theaters."
0," What we have instead is an ambitious effort that works only in patches. If this movie is a portrait, it's a fuzzy one."
1," Poverty as a central theme has been pushed so far from our flashy multiplex obsessed times, that it is almost like encountering an alien creature... Especially when it is done with such sincerity as it is in Saare Jahaan Se Mehenga, "
0," It fails to be as likeable, despite being beautifully acted by Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson."
1, A disturbing and provocative study of adolescence and isolation.
0, Neither [Carvey] nor semi-competent director Perry Andelin Blake have the ability to sustain a scene or idea.
1,A journeyman effort that's satisfyingly light on melodrama.
0," By the time the three or four false endings are finished and the credits roll, moviegoers will be left wondering whether Schrader's version will be released on DVD."
1," May not break new ground, but...it treads familiar territory with considerable dexterity."
1," Let's talk about that action though: car chases galore, explosions for days, ""making it rain,"" and trying to outrun a freaking nuclear submarine across frozen water."
0," In these 96 minutes of stilted dialogue and a plot that needlessly loops back on itself, you will find The Transporter Refueled dutifully following the rules and predictabilities of the action genre and not much else."
1," Like too many franchise installments, Catching Fire builds to more of an ellipsis than a period, teasing the next chapter instead of providing closure. But isn't that true of The Empire Strikes Back as well?"
1," Mr. Peabody & Sherman is slight, but it's exceedingly charming, making good use of a talented voice cast that includes Stephen Colbert, Leslie Mann, Mel Brooks as Freud, and Stanley Tucci as Leonardo Da Vinci."
0," At a brief 42 minutes, we need more X and less blab."
1," The picture is devilishly entertaining, not least because it's laced with just the sort of dumb raunchy jokes you hate yourself for laughing at."
1," An antidote to overly elaborate action films, John Wick: Chapter 2 doubles down on both the mythology and the violence of the first film, delivering a great followup that doesn't lose sight of what makes it so damn entertaining."
0," The laughs are few, and the homespun philosophy about as deep as a fortune cookie."
0," The TV show created an incredibly complex world over three seasons. This picture (the first in a proposed trilogy) tries to accomplish a year's worth of work in two hours. So we get titles and flashbacks, baldly expository dialogue and clumsy narration."
0," A beastly cacophony of recklessly rendered CGI, intolerable volume, and defective writing."
0," Feast suffers from spastic camera syndrome, along with a debilitating bout of hyper-editing disorder."
0," With all this inspiration going on, why is the movie so dismal?"
1," Offers up a fascinating, if unfinished, portrait of a woman's attempt to buck a system that affords her less autonomy than her intelligence and sensitivity demand. "
1, There's a sadness that permeates throughout this gritty tale about a hitman heading for Galveston in search of redemption.
0," When the cutest and most amusing thing in a movie is a pet pig on caffeine, you know you're in trouble."
1," Writer/director Rodrigo Garcia is the son of famed Colombian novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez, so maybe the filmmaker comes by all the magic and coincidence in his stories naturally."
0," It's either hell being a hillbilly or a hell of a lot of fun being a hillbilly. Here, it's hell."
0,Maybe Dublin collectively dissociated itself from the project. Who'd blame it? 
1,"Fart jokes are all too plentiful, along with copious references to bodily fluids, but in this zany context the film gets away with them. And the screenplay is crammed with witty lines. The western lives on."
0," It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid."
1, It's a horror movie of real conviction. It deserves to be a hit.
1," There are scenes that could have been lost to more decisive editing, but I found after a few days that my mind did the editing for me, and I was left with lasting impressions."
0," ""Sold"" is maudlin in a way that makes its audience, paradoxically, feel good, albeit superficially. A story of human trafficking should move us on a deeper, more uncomfortable level."
1,"John Requa and Glenn Ficarra strike a nice balance between ""war is hell"" and absurdist comedy"
0," The intention is a good one, but the blending of disparate ingredients under Andrew Davis' direction is often jarring."
0, For the most part Tooth Fairy is fairly mediocre entertainment.
1," The buzz is that this film is a life changing experience, and is anti-Semitic. I disagree on both counts. It is however, a powerful and effective illustration of John 3:16."
1,"This eagerly anticipated sequel was never going to have the same impact as the original endeavour, but as long as you bear that in mind there is plenty to take away, for there is no doubting this picture carries that same, familiar swagger."
0," The film ends up being derivative of every drug-themed, drug-centered movie we've ever seen, and goes down the same dark unforgiving and predictable path as all the others did."
1," Kriter-director George Gallo has given the stocky, ever-commanding Mueller-Stahl a heroic, bravura role and has been rewarded by the actor with a towering, complex portrayal that is surely among his finest."
1," An immensely thoughtful and well-constructed evolutionary analysis of the origins of crime, and how it subtly perpetuates throughout generations."
0, St. Vincent is full of indie clichés.
0, Even a handful of funny line deliveries from Thompson can't really justify all the extra padding.
1,"A terrific, no-nonsense B movie which comes on like something by Jean-Pierre Melville: cool, calm and dispassionate."
0, Grudge Match has just enough thoughtfulness and emotional perceptiveness to make up for the many cliche elements - offering decent but unremarkable entertainment value.
1," The film - though rife with Creeper action - is fairly light on any actual scares, [but] at the end of the day if you're a fan of the franchise, you'll be happy with this latest entry..."
1," Writer/director Kim Junsik's delicate feature is slow to catch fire but eventually blossoms into a thoughtful, touching reflection on gender, sexuality and the need to be true to yourself."
0," Lee is really letting it rip here. And although in a variety of ways Chi-Raq is overbearing and stilted, the thing is so unusual you can't help keeping your eyes glued to the screen."
0," Perhaps we have become impatient as an audience and directors are no longer keen to hold back, but sadly I feel the film was poorer for its immediate unveiling of the myriad of monsters."
0," Whatever the other flaws, the dancing itself rarely seems to disappoint in these movies."
0, Anybody looking for Ocean's Thirteen is going to be sorely disappointed.
0," So much for subtlety, not to mention sensitivity to stereotypes."
1, ... a little gem of black humor and historical revision. [Full review in Spanish]
1, This is yet another coming-of-age tale except that the hero is not a teenager but a young man who goes out of his way to be macho but really is a mama boy.
1," Split [is] a genre picture that's fascinating, audacious and just kooky enough to be a lot of fun."
0," Another middle-aged male-crisis opus, it begins on a note of total migraine-inducing hysteria, which continues unabated throughout."
0," A tale of WWII Germany as seen through the eyes of a young girl, ""The Book Thief"" is unobjectionable, sentimental, and not a little dull."
0," If anyone tries to tell you that Thank You for Smoking is a scorching satire of Big Tobacco, just tell them, well, that they're blowing smoke. "
0, Replicates the experience of viewing an arcade demo for the same length of time.
1,"An engaging look at a mangy day in the lives of two junkies trying to kick, Gridlock'd would have been a good mid-level B.O. performer even without the interest surrounding it, due to the recent death of co-star Tupac Shakur."
0," It looks harmless enough, this chick flick about attraction, rejection and commitment, but if you look closer, you might be irritated to discover women are portrayed as brainless, man-crazy twits unable to think straight when it comes to the mating game"
1,"It's Annette Bening who powers the film, holds our interest and makes us care about a woman heretofore mostly unknown to us."
0," Although the film desperately strives to achieve the salt-stained realism of, say, Peter Weir's 2003 beautifully rough-hewn epic, Master & Commander: The Far Side of the World, In the Heart of the Sea falls far short of such lofty goals."
1," Performances all around are strong, with Piper Laurie's Rose taking the lead and directing us through the story's narrative. We are invited to soak in the retro atmosphere as the story unfolds at a leisurely pace."
0," The chief draw here, of course, is Malala herself: an irrepressible, earnest voice for the oppressed. "
0," Whatever was of Steven Spielberg's original film ... has been demolished and replaced by a tacky new marquee that looks more expensive, is more expensive, and means absolutely nothing."
1,"Martin's one-liners are pretty funny, very dry, and awfully quotable."
1," It's more entertaining than it has any right to be, and I don't think I'm just saying that because I was mesmerized by Zac Efron's abs."
0, Hafstrom can't balance the requirement of excitement with the necessity of depth without jerking the film's pace around like a bad carnival ride.
1," This is a challengingly intelligent film, and Richardson is just superb."
0," Alice Through The Looking Glass is not particularly good. It's a classic case of sequel bloat, a film that seems to exist less because of any extended story it wants or needs to tell than because it must repackage something that was once popular. "
1, ... a kitschy celebration of all things Mel.
1, liltingly transcendent 
1," Clooney directed with an actor's appetite for vivid star turns, and he certainly gets them from Ryan Gosling, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Paul Giamatti. "
0," While Chappie is bursting with interesting ideas and manages to feel fresh despite obvious (and largely unloved) comparators like Short Circuit, A.I., and Transcendence, the film is sometimes blind to its own point."
1, There's something inherently hilarious about watching bitter man-children petulantly taint the innocence of childhood.
0," Self/Less didn't require a sermon, but it could have used something to anchor the story more firmly as an allegory with a conscience. It could have used more of Tarsem's distinctive Tarsem-ness, as well."
1," Wan is still effective in creating memorable and horrific imagery that lingers in the mind, as well as moments of levity in-between that are surprisingly genuine and sweet."
0, [T]he movie's inability to make up its mind on an approach sinks it.
1, Barcelona-born co-writer/director Cesc Gay's study of friendship and fate is wryly funny and mercifully free of the wailing and hand-wringing that would surely fill any potential American remake.
1, The candlelit interiors and misty forests make the film look inviting and the acting is fist rate with Farrell winning our sympathy and Dunst capturing all the longing and heartache of Edwina.
1, A stealthy film with an abrupt story full of surprises. [Full review in Spanish]
1," American Graffiti, Sixteen Candles and Dazed and Confused, bow to your new master. It super freaking rocks."
0," There's some cool plot points provided by otherwordly expert J.K. Simmons, but they quickly get lost in the shuffle of a boring movie that feels all too familiar."
0," The multiverse King created looks good on paper, but I'm worried that's the only way it will remain enjoyable. "
1, Grindhouse is insider fun when Rodriguez is in charge and regrettable trash when Tarantino takes over.
0, This is neither a satire nor an allegory. It's an infuriating and formulaic attempt at inspirational drama that panders so appallingly to an American audience hungry for uplifting tales of derring-do that it feels insulting from start to finish.
0, There's a good idea and an intriguing story hidden underneath all of Bay's boom-booms. Too bad the smoke doesn't clear long enough to see it.
1, ...less a noble failure than a very minor miracle.
0," It's let down by a disjointed and frustratingly unfocussed script, coupled with some laughably sloppy dialogue."
0,...the sum of the parts equals largely a confused mediocrity.
0, A lurid conspiracy murder tale that's decent for the first hour and then moves into the realm of the ridiculous.
1, The NASA mission at the heart of the must-see documentary Apollo 11 reminds you what it feels to be truly awestruck.
0," For better or worse, this is a movie intended solely for fans of the series."
0,... more of a gothic horror movie than an arresting biographical drama.
1," Nowar uses the Wadi Rum setting in much the same way as American director John Ford used Monument Valley: as an iconic symbol, but also as such a dominant presence that it takes on the importance of character . . . . "
0, ...the type of movie that will be forgotten in a week.
1," Patient, watchful and quietly transcendent."
0," The worst thing is that the plot tangles itself up on its own, like a liar. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," The effects are impressive but wasted in the service of a silly, so-what story."
1," When Kicks is able to find the right balance between narrative emotion and spectacle, the result is one powerful piece of work."
0,nothing we haven't seen before
1," Their hopeful, honest faces outweigh the dialogue."
1, Viewers seeking a character-driven end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it tale should be pleased.
1," It's the film's right to do so, but the real world lurks just off camera."
0," As impersonated by the evangelically thunderous Washington -- who no longer acts with other performers, he acts at them -- Alonzo feels about as 'street' as a Beverly Hills ghetto."
1," A movie that promotes the importance of family and good manners might seem like it could become the squarest of snoozes, but Paddington 2 is so transcendentally cheerful that it carries the day - and then some. "
0," Captain Mike Across America is an information-free, narcissistic and self-congratulatory high-pitched whine from a sore loser."
1, Una cinta digna de pelear con los estudios y empresas fuertes en el área y una historia entretenida y divertida que incluye los elementos claves del éxito comercial
1,The referential treatment is wise - it's truly the only way a sequel like this could get away with existing.... That interrogation becomes a quicksand in which the film is repeatedly and unfortunately bogged down.
0, The problem is Elektra is not among the most compelling of characters. She doesn't have enough humanity and the story not enough depth to sustain us between fight scenes.
1," At its worst, the film is agonizingly biopic-ish. At its best, it's a rise-and-fall movie where the first half is infinitely more compelling than the second."
0," Though there are one or two funny gags (like the Seven Dwarves as commandos), the typographical flourish in the title is the most clever thing about Happily N'Ever After."
0," After this fifth episode, you'll wish Disney would just declare the franchise dead and tell no more tales."
0, There's nothing more frustrating than wanting a movie to be great and having to admit that it falls short. At one point during The Conspirator I found myself willing it to be...
1," ""Ender's Game"" turns out to be a bit depressing, and I mean that in a good way."
0, full review at Movies for the Masses
0, If I Stay is like Twilight meets It's a Wonderful Life without the vampires and angels.
1, Inquisitive press pitted against an overreaching executive branch with present-day concerns... banter and grown-up turns akin to the best of the late Nora Ephron. The details of a 1970s newsroom and pressroom are elemental tactile poetry.
0," Tragically, Leatherheads is just OK, though the film may well find an audience among those eager for a little diversion, what with the nostalgia factor and the George Clooney factor."
0," Friday the 23rd, the day of its opening, will live in trivia infamy as one of the low points in the history of the lowly splatter genre."
0," As a diversion, Babies is like a wind-up toy that will tickle anyone with a pulse. As a documentary, it's like a cache of home videos that will frustrate anyone with an inquiring mind."
0," While it might be all in good fun, there's no way in hell a dorky pasty white teenager would be able to sneak into Atlantic Records."
0," Chastain embraces the lead in an anchoring performance, and Brühl gives a sinister performance that hearkens to his famous turn as a Nazi officer in Inglourious Basterds, but overall Zookeeper doesn't live up to its subject matter."
1, ...an achingly funny portrayal of a high schooler in search of that rarest of jewels: a confident sense of self.
0, Doyle loves bad jokes ... and his story has no rhyme or reason.
0," Director Wes Ball's film is a mad dash from one place to the next, with little time in between for rest, recuperation or plot development."
0," Even though the film's tagline confidently calls him ""the ultimate bachelor,"" Sandler doesn't walk the walk, and Segal isn't enough of a director to sell it."
0," In a lot of ways, ""The Snowman"" is like IKEA made a movie; and then they asked you to assemble it without any instructions."
0, A few scenes involving animals are irresistibly cute. But mostly we get gags starring bird droppings -- messages from the sky that are neither divine nor inspired.
1," If you are looking for a lush and enjoyably old-fashioned feature, Kenneth Branagh has done a fine job of bringing Christie's tale of murder to life."
0," It's better than Twilight...When this movie DOES something, it's actually intriguing. "
0, For those who think there'e nothing funnier than yokels acting like idiots for 90 minutes straight.
1," A pleasant if occasionally humdrum fairy tale, ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" lets us spend two hours in the company of some very nice people."
1," Redefines the word epic. I don't know what the new definition is, but it's definitely different... It's 300 times 10!"
1, The most typical film yet made in the now 12-picture Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is up to the individual viewer to decide if that's a compliment or a vicious & lacerating criticism.
1, It is very derivative -- but it has been made with diabolical amounts of energy.
0," Director Steven Spielberg is generous with mood-setting by immersing you in his beautiful visuals (heck, the movie is an hour and 58 minutes long), but it doesn't quite stir any emotion."
1,"It's rare that movies are made with such devotion to detail, even if the details are more frivolous than significant."
1," Bigger on plot than fright, Haunting succeeds in transitioning from initial boo-scare tactics to genuinely ghastly storytelling, but it's no 1408."
0, The whole package would have played better if the movie had bothered answering some of the questions it delicately raises.
0," For all of its vices, I can't help but think that we've brought Getaway on ourselves. It's not the car chase film we need right now, but it's probably the car chase movie we deserve. And if the finale is any indication, a sequel could be ready to go."
1," For viewers courageous enough to withstand the bleakest of stories and the most cynical of outcomes, House of Sand and Fog is a challenging motion picture."
0," A blissfully coked-out-of-its-mind spit-take on Eisner and the modern world of superhero cinema, The Spirit is wet bag of hot breath."
1," Jenkins' skill is in silences, and in his refusal to make people say more than they would -- no grand expository speeches here -- and in the heartache he shows in the faces of the splendid actors."
0," 120 minutes of this bloated vanity project is plenty painful, while demonstrating that the world has little to gain from Bay relaunching himself as Steven Soderbergh."
1," I'm even willing to forgive this rousing drama its coy, flirty ending, if only because its heroine has the grace not to drive her pickup truck off a cliff."
1,It's good enough that I might just start taking an interest in the books after all.
1,"Cahill clearly feels the mystery of the life experience, and he wants to explore the spiritual implications of consciousness. But he's too analytical to surrender entirely to abstracts and human fable."
1, The stakes were a good deal more than just winning or losing on the ice
0," Instead of exploring the darkness of the main character, it stays on superficial elements and never really goes deep. [Full review in Spanish] "
0,"Total Recall went through four directors before Verhoeven finally took it on, and four writers worked on the script. It's no wonder the finished film emerges without a unifying style, or a single performance worth mentioning."
0," PJ Hogan's lazy, logy Peter Pan states that not growing up is a tragedy, but presents neither evidence nor arguments. "
1, Adultery is easy; comedy is hard. But what lifts this film well above mediocrity is the presence of Woody Allen himself after a six years' absence from acting.
1, Makes its own distinct impression thanks to a finely tuned attention to atmospheric detail over broad sci-fi sensationalism.
0,It's mostly just a matter of waiting till feeding time.
1," Even though it's pretentious and overlong, A Christmas Tale is still maddeningly engaging, thanks in large part to its attractive and gifted cast."
1, This film is (be)head and shoulders above the recently reanimated likes of Prom Night and My Bloody Valentine.
0, The movie seems at times a little too pleased with itself and its mordant observations on humanity.
1, Neruda feels like such a leap into the unknown that it's almost outside the solar system - it's the Pluto of Larraín's filmography so far.
0, As short on originality and sustained tension as it is long on striking widescreen vistas and impressive technical smarts.
0, I found this film hard to embrace. Mr Watts is a strange character who seems to create problems for himself when he doesn't need to.
0, Pelham 1 2 3 ultimately plays as too old-school and low- tech to compete with the summer's other big action films.
0, Suicide Squad does have quite a few tremendously entertaining sequences of high action and low comedy. It's a shame it never rises beyond that.
0, There's no Oscar for Best Abs. 
0," The film is shrilly, luridly, dully, and unremittingly ugly, preaching to a choir that it also demonizes. "
1," Kasdan wisely doesn't make this about the big, bad bosses vs. the creative geniuses who won't compromise. It's a well-balanced look at a process, which, from the outside seems arbitrary and convoluted, but from the inside makes sense."
1, What makes the photographer's story so compelling is that her life's work actually does come alive onscreen.
1,Harron' s incisive eye and Bale' s bravura performance carry the day.
1," Even though it's not on par with the original, this is a quality sequel that hits all the marks."
1," It's a complex, moving, strikingly well-made film with a driving plot and riveting characters."
0, Oscar-winning actress Hilary Swank gives Earhart a convincing Kansas twang but little else in a performance that is unaccountably stiff.
1, ...an elegy for an American way of life that may make liberals side with the old El Paso Sheriff who bemoans today's youth with their drugs and green hair. It's a Texan lament not heard since The Last Picture Show.
0, Did I see a different film? The snafu preventing true greatness for the film - even with these gigantic talents as its characters - is the film's need to preach...
0, ...goes from poignant to amusing to tiresome...
0," It's disappointing to note, then, that The Last Word takes a fairly palpable nosedive into irrelevance as it passes the one-hour mark..."
0, I thought apes in the future were hairy humans with walnut shells for mouths! These look too much like monkeys. If I want to watch monkeys take over the world I'll watch the Jersey Shore.
0, Watching Couples Retreat cowriters Favreau and Vince Vaughn play schlubby husbands is like showing up to your high school reunion to find that the once-sharply dressed cool guys with the fake IDs are now fat and bald. And married.
0, Demolition doesn't suffer from Vallée's fine direction or Gyllenhaal's outstanding performance...
1, Have other recent Pokémon movies looked this good?
1, The pain of goodbye is beautifully balanced by the trademark excellence of the Toy Story series. A fantastic way to go out.
1, Owen and Binoche bring so much to the story as a whole that it's hard not to be won over once it gets past the rom-com cliches we've seen so many times before. 
0," So, Steve is yet another useless male character who's hidden his flaws under the professional protection of his powerful white medical coat - so what? "
0," The problem, though, is that this Tarzan really isn't very interesting, with Skarsgard's six pack about the only thing he brings to the table. "
0," The Space between Us is what it looks like when a promising premise is betrayed by a dumbed-down, hackneyed screenplay."
0, Apparently the Disney wonder-workers are just a lot of conventional hacks when it comes to telling a story with actors instead of cartoons.
0," Haunting of Connecticut doesn't have to worry about line-straddling, its crummy scares and laughable stabs at a faith-restored narrative granting it permanent residence in the realm of C-grade cheese."
1, The movie earns its right to sentiment through its performances and gentle solicitousness toward its young heroes.
0, Production Designer Santo Loquasto produced an exquisite 1930's Hollywood and New York City; one of the best things about this latest Allen cinematic entree... 
0," Allied is a prestige drama without the prestige, wooden in appearance and lacking any true drama."
0, You expect more from director Michael Apted (Enigma) and screenwriter Nicholas Kazan (Reversal of Fortune) than this cliche pileup.
1, Juliette Lewis and her crazy eyes pretty much make any movie better.
1," Darker, colder and more violent, Day of the Soldado turns out to be a surprisingly solid, in-your-face sequel to the original. Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin are once again great. [Full review in Spanish] "
1, Washington is absolutely riveting as Alonzo Harris.
1," As an old-fashioned star vehicle for Mitchell, Celeste passes muster, with few of her (human) co-stars making much impact in her slender but imposing shadow..."
0, The film's ruefully honest tone is periodically drowned out by the blare of stagey coincidences. 
1," The bottom line: The Meg is never less than big, dumb fun."
0," The film never explores the depths and nuances that could actually place Jobriath in conversation with figures who came after him, however reductively."
0," What explains this self-indulgent, meaningless, crashing bore of a movie?"
0," Despite his innate intensity, Craig seems a bit... bored, maybe? Underutilized, despite appearing in nearly every frame of the film."
0," As shocking as an Dokken album cover and, finally, as pious as The Passion of the Christ."
0," Casanova leaves us with the beautiful-but-bland Miller and the emasculated Ledger, who, frankly, was more manly and more magnetic making out with Jake Gyllenhaal in Brokeback Mountain."
1," The film's messages -- pro-family, pro-ecology, anti-consumerism -- sometimes feel forced. But Hedge is genuinely and consistently funny, for both children and parents."
0," American Sniper becomes a problematic work that dilutes its gut-gripping, conscience-blanching opening sequence with an episodic barrage of military confrontations involving dehumanized enemy targets."
1, Special effects and art design combine to create a visual spectacle able to caprture kids and adults alike. [Full review in Spanish]
1," The laughter and family fights that break out at funerals might be part of this movie's rural, working-class eye. Departures favors farmland and old-fashioned wood-fired bathhouses over the Tokyo mania. It celebrates old-style, hands-on craft."
1, We are reminded of unhappy truths about capitalism and the US way of justice. But we also get to savour that nation's perennially stirring belief in reinvention.
1," Termine de belle façon une trilogie de thrillers pour adultes, des films d'action qui ne prennent pas les cinéphiles pour des cons."
1," It's both straight-faced spy film and sly spy spoof. That's a difficult balancing act, but director James Mangold exactly right."
1, One cannot help but feel the same effect could have been accomplished by simply making a live action film with state-of-the-art visual effects.
1," Other than bits of Memento and those great Joker scenes in The Dark Knight, this may be [Nolan's] finest hour (and forty-six minutes)."
1,"For the first time in months, this critical spectator feels like tossing his old hat into the air and weaving a joyous snake dance over the typewriter keys in celebration of Metro's triumphant Woman of the Year..."
0, In Fear was made for next to nothing but that is not always a virtue. After an adequate start its storyline goes precisely nowhere.
0," Watching people live such vacuous, clone-like lives of privilege and decadence, it's impossible to feel anything for them."
0," Whether or not you appreciate Dane Cook's spastic, hyperactive brand of observational humor, he cannot be held solely responsible for the unmitigated disaster that is 'Good Luck Chuck.'"
1,"Traces the quiet failures and proud struggles of everyday lives caught up like driftwood in the currents of history . . . conjures up an exultant, slice-of-life authenticity."
1, This is going to be considered the great Superhero movie of 2007...and it's only February.
1, This is actually one of the most clever and fun films I've seen in '98.
1," By rights, a superhero sequel should be darker, more intense and more dangerous, but Favreau is happy just to stay cool. That's all Iron Man's job has ever been, and frankly, that's fine by me. "
1," Logan when, in the aftermath, our heroes navigate a battleground littered with non-combatants. For all the wrestling in the Marvel Universe with collateral damage, this is the best, most devastating representation of it."
0," Beyond the stunning animation (they finally got hair right!), there's little to recommend besides the fact that it's a touch better than Shrek the Third."
1," In The Loop may have worked equally well on TV, but no rib is left untickled in a quickfire satire that depresses as much as it amuses. Gets our vote."
1," A little long, but quietly rewarding."
0, Good cast plus weak script equals so-so movie.
1, That it's a film both timely and timeless goes without saying. Yet Clooney is too canny a storyteller to let didacticism obscure the complexities of Murrow's character.
1," When ""20th Century Women"" ends, it's not with the same air of hope and possibility. That's after all, not its purpose. Instead it finds an essential shared moment in time where these great characters converge...'we'll always have Santa Barbara in '79.'"
1," There's an irony here: In the interest of dramatic expediency, Iannucci has made the power players of The Death Of Stalin look more competent and more decisive than their real counterparts."
0," If you're new to this crazy Mel Brooks creation, this 2005 cinematic torture chamber is the last way anyone should experience it for the first time."
0, This lame martial-arts superhero action film has a lot more in common with Highlander and the long-forgotten video game that spawned the Double Dragon.
1," If your kids have been totally weaned on ADD-addled animated flicks that mostly coast on crude humor and instantly dated pop culture references, then this clearly isn't the film for them."
0,"If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then Gary Fleder's Don't Say a Word is one of the most complimentary films to hit the screens in years."
1, ... there is an underlying honesty... that manages to transcend a critic-friendly film and strike a chord about life.
0," It is what it's about - kissing frogs for ratings, entertainment that panders to the lowest common denominator."
1, Paddington is perfect.
0," When Ted sits on his couch watching a clip from ""Roots"" and compares his situation to that of Kunta Kinte getting whipped, you may want to sink into your seat."
0, The most interesting thing about Wanted is that its protagonist is one of the most unlikable action heroes in memory.
1, A work that's far less dramatic than it ought to be.
0, Often contrived and clunky while falling emotionally flat with a dull screenplay and mediocre performances. It ultimately bites off much more than it could chew. 
0, You always have to be careful with the initial releases of any calendar year.
0," The film is, first and above all, just not much fun at all, and that would appear to be the most important thing for it to have been."
0," The effects are scanty, the drama gloomy, the philosophy of the film thick as a cloud of ozone. The plot is not all that original either."
1," Precious is a force of nature. You don't simply watch the movie, you experience it -- in all its fury, hope, bitterness, grace, horror and redemption."
0," Considering the central characters would become the dominant figures of the Beat movement, it's unbelievable how pedestrian their antics prove, not to mention how through-the-roof the picture's corn quotient is. Could the soundtrack have more bongo music?"
0," When Mark Wahlberg's Silva isn't wielding run-on sentences as military-grade weapons, he barks out derivative commands and asinine statements that make him sound like a 13-year-old playing Call of Duty."
1, One of the best sustained horror movies for some years.
1," Affleck's eye as a director is relentlessly curious, constantly looking for the details that sell the emotion or the tension or the subtext, and it feels like he's become very confident."
1," Man's love of sports has caused more friction in marriages than balancing the family checkbook. Fever Pitch explores that age-old dilemma admirably, even if it only gets to third base."
1," It all cops out at the end as all wedding pics do, but along the way there's plenty of fine acting, sharp dialogue and sexual intrigue to keep most audiences interested. "
0, Suffers from a preposterous set-up and even more ludicrous plot developments.
1," This is Brand's film, and every aspect of his persona is played to the max - the sexual magnetism, the multiple addictions, the doting but distant mum, the hangers-on and women who want to control him."
0," Seyfried's Lovelace gets a lot of screen time, but rarely to herself. Instead she's there for things to happen to...What does Lovelace tell us about Linda Lovelace that is not already part of the public domain? Not a lot, really."
1," Noah shines not so much in the scripted moments, but in the scenes in between."
0,"The movie, with room to gallop through nearly two hours and an R rating, often just kicks around in the stable."
1," A work of fiction, based on present-day fact, that's quietly affecting and surprisingly dramatic, so long as you're willing to watch it unfold at its own deliberate pace."
0, No wonder the trip takes so long: 16 Blocks insists on taking only the most heavily travelled routes.
0," Couples Retreat is neither funny nor honest. The exact opposite of a retreat, it's merely exhausting."
0," ...eye candy for those who want to see barely dressed men simulating sex. If that's not you, you needn't bother."
0, The movie as a whole feels cynical and exhausted.
1," I wasn't expecting to gain any kind of apotheosis or epiphany from watching Neville's documentary about Mister Rogers, but that's precisely what happened. Life is weird that way."
0, Interminably slow
0," A high-tech variation on The Desperate Hours (1955, 1993), this thoroughly formulaic thriller, in which a middle-aged everyman has to go mano a mano with the bad guys who threaten his family, goes through the motions with singular dispiritedness."
0," Cox doesn't so much chew the scenery as inhale it. Dano looks on in awe. Who can blame him? For that matter, who can blame Cox?"
1,"Excellent performances, a great soundtrack, and the Hughes' technical virtuosity make it worth a look."
1," There is nothing startling or challenging about Quartet, but it's a delightful film that touches on themes of ageing and the enduring importance of art."
0, At least when Moe hit Curly in the head with a hammer it wasn't the re-creation of a real crime.
1, A movie for those of you who like to fill out the crossword puzzle or play Sudoku daily
1," It's a lightweight confection, but Pitch Perfect is great fun while the fat lady (and the skinny one) sings."
0," There's nothing new about the political smoke-and-mirrors; the Bullock/Thornton relationship fails to convince, and the inevitable idealistic resolution feels unsatisfying and unearned."
0," A tepid thriller that begins promisingly before simultaneously jumping the tracks, jumping the shark, and jumping off a cliff."
1," Sleepy Hollow's strength is in its look, which is jaw-droppingly beautiful, a personal best for director Tim Burton."
1," Movies don't get much juicier, funnier, creepier, sadder, or smarter."
1," We wanted less of all that faux mythology, more of the hand-to-hand fighting and coy pop cultural references, and more opportunities for Brie Larson to show off her comic timing. Captain Marvel is good, but could easily have been better."
1," a career capping performance from Kristin Scott Thomas with wonderful support from Zylberstein, but ... [Claudel] stumbles with his climatic revelation, a contrived piece of writing that turns his already sympathetic heroine into a martyr."
1," At its best, the film's silence and unrevealing mood of observation remind you of 'The Passenger' or Paulo Sorrentino's 'Consequences of Love'..."
0," The beautiful game, as Pelé called football (or soccer to us Americans), has never felt like such a sedate slog."
1, It hurts to see those bars erected around the house. It hurts worse to see them mounted in the girls' minds.
0," While the big set pieces are often exuberantly handled, the human details are sorely wanting. Hergé achieved more expression with his use of ink-spot eyes and humble line drawings than a bank of computers and an army of animators were able to achieve"
0," Unfortunately, nobody ever won an Oscar for washboard abs. And nobody is going to win five seconds of admiration for 115 minutes of tedium in The Gunman."
0, Praise Jesus that Tyler Perry found Angela Bassett.
1," Fascinating, atmospheric, and utterly strange in ways both good and bad, Ghostbox Cowboy pulls back the curtain on those trying to export the American dream and reaping the whirlwind."
1," Direction is superb, balancing action, story, character and something valuable to say in a compelling movie that you wish wouldn't end. And when the end does come, we wish all thrillers could be so genuine and real"
0, Unbalanced... disingenuous... cares no more about Africa than do the story's evil villains at a make-believe drug company.
1," The Transformers franchise has given us a breath of fresh air with their latest venture, Bumblebee; the first film in the franchise filled with ample amounts of heart, humor, fun and memorable action!"
1, Mickey Rourke is heart-breakingly good.
1, It's as if Aronofsky has a direct pipeline into my nightmares.
0," The ongoing struggle to make cyber crime an exciting time at the movies continues with Michael Mann's Blackhat, a ridiculous mish-mash of genre stereotypes."
0," Disappointing dance drama that suffers from a badly scripted plot, dull performances and poorly choreographed dance routines."
1, Hits the bull's eye with its thematically relevant portrait of the clash between hostility and hospitality as the major challenge facing humans in the twenty-first century.
0," Rosewater certainly has merit as an act of atonement on Stewart's part and a tribute to people like Bahari... In the end, however, the movie needs to stand on its own, apart from its noble intentions and the popularity of its writer-director."
0," Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt in a science-fiction love story -- what could go wrong with that? Turns out, quite a lot."
0, A beautiful bore.
0," Quirk and harmony only take the feature so far, keeping the movie inert and repetitive as it meanders to a close, leaving behind a half-realized psychological profile and a bustling world of talent left unexplored."
0,"What - what - have they created here? Really folks, I'm at a loss..."
1," An Inconvenient Truth can't, of course, reveal a future that is still up to us, but by the time you're done watching, the real question is, Which way on God's green earth would you want to err?"
0," Pandering shamelessly to 15-year-old boys, it's sexist, obnoxious and, unlike the superior Superbad, mean-spirited - especially if you're a dog or a dwarf."
1, Chazelle's ambivalent portrait of Armstrong is a strength. I'm not looking for movies to further mythologize heroes; I need real heroes - imperfect people of action.
0, You know you're in trouble when an allegedly adult romantic comedy begins with a fart joke.
1, Panahi ... offers a profound meditation on art and its power to elevate the seeming mundane into sublime beauty
1,"Sometimes director Werner Herzog - a master, for nearly four decades, at blending the bizarre and the mundane - does let you in on Cage's motives. But just as often, he delivers a life, and a world, of random mayhem."
1," Harold sustains an unsettling tone and the graphic depiction of what goes on under the knife is, well, a surgery-phobic patient's worst nightmare"
0, It's amazing how fast a fresh comedy idea can go stale.
1,A film that is political in nature and very controversial for the Iranian authorities to deal with...
1,"This is Bond as interpreted by the British director Sam Mendes and shot by the renowned cinematographer Roger Deakins, and one of the first things that strike you is how sumptuous it looks."
1, An entertaining action comedy that doesn't disappoint. [Full Review in Spanish] 
1," When Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie isn't funny, it's really not funny. When it's funny, it's terrifically deranged."
1, Not even Errol Morris' infamous Interrotron - a camera-rig that gazes right into the subject's freaking soul - can pierce an unyielding Donald Rumsfeld in The Unknown Known.
0," The sequences illustrating the fairy tale are rendered in a handsome water color style, but even these scenes feel too slow and deliberate to enliven the film."
0," Maybe Cameron Crowe was attempting to evoke the confusing complexities of adult life, but if so, he did his job too well. Confusion washes over this film in waves."
1," The film may be self-indulgent at times, but stars Segel and Eisenberg anchor the proceedings with just the right amount of emotion and complexity."
1, Parental Content Review
1, A horrifying vision of globalization gone terribly amuck.
1," A war film, yes, and a film about empowerment and romance. But it's also a movie about movies."
0,[K]nows it's a videogame movie and knows it's an Aliens ripoff and still can't muster up enough winkingness or snark to at least be clever about it...
0," Unfortunately, it just doesn't come together."
0,"A random episode of American Idol offers more comedy and drama, not to mention more disturbing insights into contemporary popular culture, than American Dreamz."
1," Tartakovsky's zippy, boing-boing touch shines through in the purely physical antics of the monster mob; words aren't necessary as the freaks bounce around the place with nutso energy."
1," A passionate, clearly articulated, if sloppily structured indictment of the president, his ties to the bin Laden family, his relentless push for war in Iraq and, as portrayed by Moore, an ineptitude bordering on the criminal."
0," The stench of death and dread permeates every frame of United 93, but it is nowhere near as strong as the stink of synergy."
1," The irony here is between the powerful merge of cinematic storytelling, history, and the dominant role of the market, because if Sir Ridley Scott's epic doesn't make a profit, there won't be a sequel, and more's the pity."
1," Spielberg is an efficient, consummately competent director, and the action sequences deliver exactly what's promised, if nothing more."
0," Wafts out of the ether like the ghosts of bad movies past, the very picture of the cinema's dog days of August."
1," You know what? This movie's good. It's fast, deftly paced and funny, and only some misjudged violence in the last lap keeps it from being better than good."
1, Retaliation is less a sequel than an antidote to the calcified mound of crap that ostensibly inspired it.
1," McG has sparked a moribund franchise back to life, giving fans the post-apocalyptic action they've been craving since they first saw a metal foot crush a human skull two decades ago."
0," Scoring high for creativity, the story of the fantastic life of urban nomad and unwilling Bolshevik Jan Dite gives us too little to hang on to. This is hard work for a laugh."
1," Last Chance Harvey is nothing you haven't seen before. It's just done with older actors, a bit more poignancy, and a bit more class"
1," While Breillat's latest does not exactly qualify as entertainment, it makes the unwatchable something we want dearly to watch."
0, Delivers its message with unfortunate directness
0," Continually, I bemoan the fact that viewers of faith - and I'm among them - are under-served when it comes to high-quality faith-based films."
0," Immy Humes no doubt needed to make this movie, and the PR set (Mailer, Matthiessen, Plimpton) obviously enjoy the trip down memory lane, but while Doc makes for a fascinating subject, Doc feels intended less for us than for them."
0,"Jack Black and Cate Blanchett are a delightful duo, but a sense of wonder never takes hold here. It's a movie about magic that's disappointingly dull."
1, The results haunt the back of your skull.
0, Somewhere Vin Diesel is laughing all the way to the bank.
0," At the end, Transformers: The Last Knight promises yet another sequel ... At least it'll take a lot of effort for the follow-up to be worse than this."
1," A typical Hollywood comedy with this plot could have easily descended into a litany of gay-panic moments and not-so-veiled homophobia. But I Love You, Man thankfully avoids that trap."
0," Terrified to do anything different (which, believe it or not, would be entirely possible)...it only takes a moment of awareness to step outside the movie and see how poorly written, insultingly recycled, and anti-creative Jason Bourne is."
1,A B-movie is what this is. And it works fairly well on that level.
1, This is one of the best movies Marvel has created.
1," Punch lines and outrage come easy, but beware: If you walk into this film with a secure moral judgment, prepare to have it shaken by the time you leave."
1," Its dark, somber tone allows for a humor that feels far more human in temperament than that of any comedy released by Hollywood this year."
1,"a great, clever concept, and it's family fun"
0, I am not going to try to explain the story- after watching this movie I may never try to explain another story ever again.
0, ...fitful laughs...
1, Well worth the trip.
0,The music's as troubled as the subject matter
1," I suppose it's foolish to expect verisimilitude in a comic book movie -- especially one as entertaining as this proves to be. Besides, they'll have other chances to get it right, now that X-Men: First Class has regained its mojo."
1, Watch the film for its superbly executed action and for more of a story than the last one. And for the behemoth called Denzel Washington...
0," They all yell at the sky while shaking their fists, utter overly dramatic lines with such conviction, and seem fully aware of the absurdity of the film."
1," The effect is akin to a mediated staring contest: the film audience looks into the eyes of the individual people on screen, who look back, their expressions changing in slow-motion, as Glass's minor-key score triggers emotional synapses deep within."
1,Sweaty and scrappy with sports stereotypes and showboating sentiment...
1, Not short on dewy depictions of animal relationships and the healing powers of pooch presence. What's added here is a layer of darkness that's unexpected.
1," Brilliant film by Jodie Foster, with Oscar-level performances."
0, There are so many lame gags in the film that viewers may feel assaulted. But at least the pace is lively.
0," It's as if the film is a no-humour zone, and any attempt at a laugh gets sucked into a cinematic vacuum of mirthlessness."
0, An approach to comedy we've seen many times before. [Full Review in Spanish] 
1," It's a rousing adventure, in parts; a film of great moments rather than a great film with a pattern of suspense that trails up and down like a hobbit over a mountain range."
1,"Cumberbatch nails it. If only the film did, too."
1, A quixotic film of tone-poem rhythms about the unquenchable desire for lost love.
1," A fitting epitaph for a great artist. Every frame could be hung on a wall, the script is supremely thoughtful and the performances are universally excellent."
0, The story is so convoluted and ultimately preposterous that you're almost embarrassed by the earnestness of the actors trying to carry it off.
0," Even in the context of Shetty's oeuvre, Dilwale is a low. It made me nostalgic for Chennai Express."
1," Hip, brutally honest and humane..."
1,"I liked The Soloist more than most disease/triumph over adversity movies. It's more believable, more sincere and just more interesting than most. I just can't get over the feeling of filmmakers patting themselves on the back..."
1," Kore-eda, talented director that he is, never allows the story to sink into soap-opera melodrama, and he refrains from pointing fingers."
0, Possibly the most boring movie ever made about kinky sex.
0," This insultingly slap-dash sequel has as little relation to the original ""Die Hard"" as it does to logic and narrative coherence."
1,"The dark, dreamy cityscapes created for the film are almost as alive as the characters."
0," Unusually for a studio picture, the basic elements of filmmaking - script, acting, editing and even the soundtrack choices - are below par in The Darkest Minds."
1,Steven Spielberg's dino-park thrill ride comes up eye-wateringly shiny in this rereleased version - even if its clunkier elements have become a bit more obvious with time.
0," Presented with the opportunity to do the first-ever big-budget Easter bunny flick mixing live action and animation, ""Hop"" gives us . . . a bunny who poops jelly beans."
0," Technically, Basic seems thrown together at the last minute."
0, The fact of the matter is The House with a Clock in Its Walls simply isn't that exciting. It's set in a world of magic and wonder that rarely feels magical or wonderful.
0, Not only is The Departed not among the best of Scorsese's films; it's not even the best version of this film.
0, becomes bogged down and eventually engulfed by its bewildering lack of rationality
0," As visually overcast as it is emotionally dead-eyed, The Mountain is probably the most intentionally-and unwarrantedly-bleak film you're likely to see in 2018."
0," The poster is more clever than anything in the movie, which is sporadically funny but completely devoid of personality."
1," Plays like a toddler running along a lumpy field, stumbling every few feet but always getting back up and eventually reaching his destination, unharmed and happy."
0, Disjointed and unsatisfying. While some stories soar - the titular vignette is stirring and beautiful - too many others fall flat or get lost in the search for profundity as characters spend an inordinate amount of time staring into the middle distance.
1," Ambitious and often unwieldy, but savory in its construction and earnestness. John Carter is sadly undeserving of its flop status."
1," It's a film containing few surprises and plenty of clichés but, nonetheless, is an entertaining way to fill a couple of hours."
0," ... a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating, that is, for about ten minutes. After that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course."
0," There are much better alternatives to The Bye Bye Man such as The Babadook, Candyman, and even I Know What You Did Last Summer. You may want to watch those instead."
1," In scene after scene, ""Menashe"" strikes complex notes without telegraphing how the audience should feel."
1," Cooper was never more handsome, and the chemistry between him and Hayes glows from the screen."
1, An endearing romp through gothic nonsense.
1," Outrageous as the 'Okja' plot may seem, it deals with important issues and makes us think-- not simply enjoy. It ends up being a movie that matters. "
0," At its prettiest and most self-indulgent, it plays like a cinematographer's reel with a massacre at the end."
0, Duris brings an edgy vulnerability that makes him a sympathetic figure through a tale that never quite adds up.
0," For those who loved all those idiot action films of the '80s (or want to know what they were like), Rambo is the real deal."
1, Sometimes a movie arrives out of the blue that announces the arrival of considerable new talents.
0," Once the characters go underground, things start happening. Not scary things, mind you, but things."
1,"I'm not going to argue that Reign of Fire is a good movie, but it's terribly entertaining it's kind of a classic camp film, so I'm giving it thumbs up."
1, Will open your eyes to a rare talent.
0, It's best to wait for home viewing on this one.
1," Hail, Caesar! is very, very funny with two or three of possibly the funniest scenes in the Coens' entire career..."
0," Stella's groove, like the film itself, doesn't run deep."
0, It's an unpleasant way to pass a couple summer hours.
1," ""fine as it is, it would have been finer with Julie Andrews"""
1, A visually striking film but hollowed-hearted.
0," Allegedly all these incidents connect symbolically in Barney's mind, but in the viewer's, they thud, inert and separate as stones."
1, A mature drama that demands rapt attention and prefers studied execution over frenetic pacing.
0," Savage Grace doesnâ(TM)t seem quite sure of how to communicate its own fascination with such doings, whether to convey shock, envy, pity or bemusement."
0," Aftermath, with its promising premise, could have been an intense drama but what you get instead is a wandering, forgettable story that reeks of nothingness."
0,"There will never be a tamer, lamer movie made about streetball."
0," stumbles out of the gate, falls, and never rights itself. For the Halloween offering that its studio hoped it would be, it's all trick and no treat."
1, Portrait of an egomaniac capitalizing on technology remains plenty valuable as a peek into the past that few would want to see become the future.
0, You've seen all of this before. There's nothing new in the story beats or in the movie's construction.
1," Winterbottom has chosen to emphasize naturalism and realistic detail, with a minimum of sentimental content."
1," If any film deserves to be a hit in 2015, it's this brilliant piece of cinema."
1," Feel-good romance tackles serious themes, disability rights. "
1," The African Queen is top flight entertainment, delightful, different, always interesting."
0, We're sitting through a glorified B-movie with nothing new to say.
0, This cast is simply too generic. None of the young thespians stick out.
0," Poltergeist meets The X-Files when an average US suburban family is plunged into horror, blah blah blah."
0, Stupid is good for comedies and some action movies. But this isn't one of them.
0, Its slapstick-y nonsense [is] stretched so painfully thin that the proceedings venture perilously close to becoming little more than a superpowered slog.
1," In ""The Descent,"" look beyond the stalagmites. Leaping amid them and eager for fresh meat are an amphibious race of blood-sucking beasts who appear to have been poached beyond the boiling point."
0," Here, the audience is made to watch Adam Sandler's summer vacation video, which displays how much fun he had, and how little of that merriment and camaraderie translated to the screen."
1," Flawed as it is, The Phantom Menace captured my imagination and I enjoyed it."
1, Cage and Herzog click together better than just about any first-time actor & director combination in recent memory.
1," Tarkovsky's hypnotic framing of Gorchakov's experience is made possible through his signature pacing, extended tracking shots, and slow zooms and focusing."
1," A beautifully executed film that is remarkable on many, many levels."
1," The high-octane train sequences are staged with increasingly nail-biting tension, admirably shot without reverting to computer-generated trickery."
0, [Director] Fleming is compelled to push for that contemporary upgrade and he fills the film with many airheaded moments that feel like outtakes from every other teen flick.
1,"It may be dry and sullen, but it's also smart and classy."
1," ""Nico, 1988"" ... understands the mystique of her anti-mystique, and deserves to attract a small but fascinated audience on the specialty circuit."
0," For all the trickiness and bluster, Shutter Island is dead inside."
0," The problems stem from ragged storytelling, a surfeit of silly epigrams and a jangle of accents and cultures that leaves you wondering where Mr. Nolte's strangulated crook fits in."
1, A nice turn from Mr. T keeps the grade (barely) above C level.
0," The characters are all interesting individually, and yet none are compelling or involving. With life reduced to one-liners, they have no way to develop a chemistry with each other or with the audience."
0," If this were a legit biopic of just about anybody, it'd be a hugely irresponsible portrayal. But in fiction, eh, whaddaya gonna do."
1," Though we know how it ends, it unfolds with suspense. And though it lacks any discussion of the towers' destruction, it succeeds as a tribute to their birth."
1," The result is a fascinating document, not only of the star herself, but also of the documentary as personal process."
0,Good Luck Chuck has its moments - though the half-decent comedy moments are outweighed by the gags that fizzle and the cruddy loutish moments.
1,"Soderbergh is back for real, with no signs of rust at all "
1," One of the finest sex-and-politics thrillers ever made, blending sharp humour with riveting suspense."
0," Striptease stinks. Yes, that's a crude, perhaps even rude, assessment. But crude and rude are the two terms that sum up this alleged comedy."
0," ... moderately creepy but not scary, more tedious than thrilling, and it seems like a lesser effort from the versatile del Toro."
0, Fails in being an entertaining satire and a competent horror film...
1, Consider it 'Fried Green Falafel.'
1," It's like one of those great Horizon episodes from the 1980s or 90s, before all science docs started sounding as if they were written for overexcited seven-year-olds."
0," The problem with Focus is that it never really does - and in its fuzzy-edged attempts to pull off the long con, the film ends up picking its own pocket."
1, Bava displays how ahead of the curve he was in tackling the slasher genre.
0, I'm not gonna sugarcoat this: Movies don't have to be this bad.
1,"[Hackman and Romano] work well together here, and Tierney does a heroic job of playing a character who doesn't know how the story will end, when everybody else, in the cast and in the audience, has an excellent idea."
0, drags harder than when Herzog tried to pull that boat over a mountain
0, Jake Schreier delivers a completely superficial film. [Full review in Spanish]
0," Collide isn't just a giant waste of time that only brings the worst out of its impressive cast, but it unforgivably takes an eternity to end and put you out of your misery."
0, This heavy-handed movie is simply a sermon its makers think we all should hear.
1,"This takeoff on the children's-book series refreshingly balances sweet and bitter tones; Pooh's innocence irritates Christopher before it redeems him, and Madeline undertakes a bold adventure to gain her father's attention."
1, Searching follows Eighth Grade as another thought-provoking film about the intersection between teens' lives and their presence-and reliance-on social media.
1," The Last Jedi has been favourably compared to The Empire Strikes Back and while there's some truth to that, they're very different films. Yes, it's dark but it's the moments of light that you'll remember."
0, I was bored out of my skull. 
1, Oddball existential western animation.
0, A one sided look at the argument against drilling for natural gas; Damon needs to entertain and stay off his soapbox.
0,This is almost mesmerisingly bad.
0," Certainly touching, even heart-rending at times, and it mostly steers clear of the didacticism and sentimentality its subject matter often invites. But it never takes the full measure of its modest heroine, and makes her world a bit too small."
0,"As is the case with other unsatisfactory diversions, it is entirely possible to ignore the worst parts of this movie, to drift along during the lulls, slide over the half-baked jokes and just wait for Ms. McCarthy and Mr. Bateman to do their things."
0, Steve Prefontaine must have been something special -- everyone says so -- but there's no magic on the screen.
1," An astonishing story, well told. "
0, The profoundly discouraging ending doesn't work.
1,"Apart from looking like no other type of animated film, Chicken Run stands alone in its unwavering determination not to play down to the kiddies."
1," For the most part, Lee and company still manage to coax solid laughs and to give the grim facts the gravity they deserve."
1," The Last of the Unjust demands patience and commitment from the viewer but the reward is an utterly fascinating, spellbinding history lesson."
1," The Shape of Water is a breathless film, anchored by [Sally] Hawkins' visible, ardent longing for connection, and her fierce defiance when the things she loves are threatened"
1, You don't need to wait for Angelina Jolie to rise from the vaporous depths naked to know that this Beowulf isn't your high school teacher's Old English epic poem.
1," If it didn't turn out to be the Oscar contender it was apparently intended to be, it is nonetheless a fascinating film about our culture and what we really think is of value."
0," None of it appears to be well thought out, or thought through, and it's consequently never remotely believable."
1,"Watts holds our attention and sympathy, even when the plot floats into the ether."
0," Aniston's less than substantial acting talents are put to the test by this role, and she just barely manages to keep her head above water."
1, It's fun to watch for the monster-movie homages sprinkled throughout.
0, The film is so slow and distant it's more likely to test one's patience than their faith.
0," If Mystery Science Theater 3000 had never existed, Dead Snow would have had to invent it."
1, A bleak vision of modern Britain that just escapes slipping into a slough of miserabalism by virtue of some light-hearted segments ...
1, A rare example of a franchise improving with each new instalment; Fallout is a benchmark setter that begs to be seen on the big screen. 
0, It'll take you roughly five minutes to realize that Noah is going about things the wrong way; it'll take him more than 90. 
1," Nonetheless, having made the occupants of the White House seem believably human in The American President and in The West Wing, Sorkin knows it's better to focus on his characters' hearts, no matter how black, than their coding fingers"
0," The imaginatively cast, gorgeously designed movie has moments of wry wit and oddball charm. But its lumpish plot reinforces the suspicion that solid storytelling is no longer a Hollywood priority."
0," As fun and smart as the political sketches are, the director had plenty of room to shill, say, the Bass-o-Matic or Bad Idea Jeans."
0, DeKnight's considerable talent feels jilted by an aggressively commercial experience. Uprising takes the Pacific Rim story and turns it into a brand.
0, Surrogates is yet another film that got swallowed by the Hollywood machine and spit out the other side. It's a surrogate of itself.
0," Unfortunately, this is a broad family comedy that depends on odd sound effects (zonks! splat!) during every scene..."
0," Full of good intentions and lessons, perhaps this was the reason to its great success as a book, but as a movie it fails entirely. [full review in Spanish]"
1, A comedy that takes place under an absurd tone and has a great cast of stars. [Full review in Spanish]
0," A mostly laugh-free, paint-by-numbers approach to a pair of former pros vying for relevance as they enter, kicking and screaming, into their mid 30s."
1,"Bittersweet whimsy pervades the biting humor as Allen once again examines the subject of romance and the bumbling, self-destructive ways people go about trying to find it and then to hang on to it"
1," Chattily cruel, ecstatically gentle, Vol 2 creates an off-centre world you don't want to leave."
1," The film is a guaranteed tearjerker, but more than that, an uplifting tribute to a single woman's quest for independence that would surely make Bridget Jones blush."
1, Is Unsane the Get Out of the #MeToo movement? It just might be. Steven Soderbergh's neo-Snake Pit/Shock Corridor is a cinema resonant film for our times.
1," An old-fashioned streak of adventure runs throughout The Kid Who Would Be King, a riff on the King Arthur legend gussied up for modern times."
1," This is a typically barebones plot from the Dardennes, and the filmmakers manage to extract significant amounts of suspense, humanity and even a few dark laughs from Sandra's exchanges."
1, The Force is strong with this film -- a perfect fit as a prequel to A New Hope.
1," A full-throttled, double-barrelled zomcom through the United States of Zombieland."
1,A deliriously odd and funny movie that manages to be dark and uplifting at the same time.
0, A thrift-shop Wes Anderson pastiche masquerading as the latest in cult-film haute couture.
0, Addicted is the kind of film for which the Alan Smithee pseudonym was invented.
0, I'll try my luck against the contamination I think.
0," There's plenty of talk about American Sins in American Assassin, but none of it changes the fact that the bad guys want to do bad things and must be stopped, so there really isn't much point to all that chatter."
