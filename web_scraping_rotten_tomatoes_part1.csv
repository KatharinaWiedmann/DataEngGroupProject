0,The Invisible Man,"A bracingly modern #MeToo allegory that, despite its brutal craft, rings hollow.",rotten
1,The Invisible Man,"A smart, unexpected delight.",fresh
2,The Invisible Man,"Whannell uses stillness and empty spaces against the audience expertly. But it's Moss who most sells this new, self-consciously serious take on a hammy monster movie premise.",fresh
3,The Invisible Man,"While chock full of relatively good scares, campy effects and an ending that will tickle a very specific demographic of 1990s and 2000s thriller fans with glee, The Invisible Man doesn't deliver more than that.",rotten
4,The Invisible Man,"In this heart-stopping update, the 'Gotcha!' moments really do surprise.",fresh
5,The Invisible Man,There's some cruelty in this visual; there are moments when The Invisible Man is not fun to watch. But the movie's violence opens up a larger question...,fresh
6,The Invisible Man,"The Invisible Man is horror filmmaking of the finest kind ... a smart, self-aware work that is both frightening and provocative, an of-the-moment work of art that exquisitely updates a genre classic.",fresh
7,The Invisible Man,"It's hard to imagine a film that feels more of the moment than The Invisible Man. Smart and scary in equal measure, it sets the new gold standard for remaking classic horror properties.",fresh
8,The Invisible Man,Whannell and Moss team up for a memorable if imperfect frightener that recasts HG Wells' story as a harrowing domestic violence horror.,fresh
9,The Invisible Man,"Filmmaker Alex Garland kills it once again with ""Devs,"" a dramatic thriller, that returns to the ideas of A.I., only now developed to quantum proportions.",fresh
10,The Invisible Man,"We've seen the man who makes himself invisible, but it turns out seeing the one in view of the man who can't be seen is compelling for an entirely different reason.",fresh
11,The Invisible Man,"It's essentially silly stuff, and overextended, but Moss is great and there are several good flourishes. At his most devilish, the indiscernible psycho is worth seeing.",fresh
12,Sonic the Hedgehog,"Sure, there's enough here to divert small people for a while, but their parents would do well to bring a blindfold and ear plugs.",rotten
13,Sonic the Hedgehog,The world contains many terrible video game movies. This isn't one of them.,fresh
14,Sonic the Hedgehog,"The simple storyline finds a way to adapt the games' characters and themes, by adding universal concepts such as friendship to the original games' tension between nature and machines.",fresh
15,Sonic the Hedgehog,"Affectionate, charming, and genial.",fresh
16,Sonic the Hedgehog,I was just thrilled to be reminded of everything Jim Carrey can do when he lets himself riff.,fresh
17,Sonic the Hedgehog,"Whatever else it may achieve, Sonic the Hedgehog is unlikely to elevate the based-on-a-videogame category above the dismal level where it has wallowed for the past quarter-century.",rotten
18,Sonic the Hedgehog,"The movie's bright visuals and snappy rapport between Marsden and Schwartz keep things silly and alive, never taking itself too seriously but rarely being too light to be outright dismissed.",fresh
19,Sonic the Hedgehog,"This live-action film has a chance of keeping children briefly entertained with its skilfully engineered set pieces, but it's trite and sugary, and Jim Carrey can't redeem it.",rotten
20,Sonic the Hedgehog,"The property is better off as a videogame where if the character gets too bothersome with its antics, one can simply put a stop with the push of a button.",rotten
21,Sonic the Hedgehog,"It's a nice little nugget, nice little soft family joint.",fresh
22,Sonic the Hedgehog,Jim Carrey is honestly the best thing about Sonic the Hedgehog - we need a Robotnick spin off next,fresh

31,The Call of the Wild,It's extremely easy to split the film into its bad part and its good part.,rotten
32,The Call of the Wild,"This take on Jack London's tale isn't entirely faithful to nature... But this adds to the fun of the hokey, action-packed children's entertainment, and there is nothing too fake about Harrison Ford's turn as a grey-bearded loner.",fresh
33,The Call of the Wild,"This story requires the involvement of a real dog to stir up all the proper emotions, but the filmmakers are more interested in having their canine lead perform amazing feats. If Superman is looking for Krypto, he can find him hiding out in this picture.",rotten
34,The Call of the Wild,"Rather than technology for technology's sake, the animation in the Harrison Ford-led movie about a dog rediscovering his true nature is profoundly deliberate...",fresh
35,The Call of the Wild,"With Ford's gnarled presence grounding the narrative, animation vet Chris Sanders takes full advantage of his photo-realistic CGI lead...[it] sustains the whiff of nature while actually learning a few new tricks.",fresh
