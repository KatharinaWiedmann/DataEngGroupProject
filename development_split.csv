193687," Surprisingly, this insightful tearjerker is padded with expressive layers well beyond the average made-for-television sentiments because of the penetrating performances.",1
147195," The ride in Due Date is not only the usual raucous escapade, with car crashes and run-ins with authorities, but also takes a turn toward what might be called Peter's dark side. ",0
234815, the film that made consummate French actor Jean Gabin a star,1
365206," ""... There is a been-there-done-that feeling permeating all of 'Dark Shadows,' no matter how entertaining it might be at times.",0
136996," It is a very compelling movie, despite the fact that the story hops around back and forth in its time line like a crazed wallaby.",1
186679," The Human Centipede, by skillful Dutch director Tom Six, might be compared to Hollywood schlock like Hostel. But it has a style and sense of humor sorely lacking in the American movies.",1
191983, DreamWorks' first animated film to blow Disney out of the water.,1

323888," A perfect example of what is perceived as ""escapism.""",1
357278," Friday stars several actors who can't act. It also stars a rapper who can't rap. His name is ""Ice Cube"" and, after seeing this movie (among others) he can officially name himself the king of movies that lack acting talent, as far as I'm concerned.",0
164984, a fitfully engrossing and overreaching film that is both somehow too much and yet not enough.,0

65100," Like Knightley's performance, it's not entirely successful but it's always compelling.",1
22348," Olnek has crafted a lovely, heart-warming piece which reminds us of the importance of revisiting and challenging historical narratives and leaves one in both fits of laughter and in need of a few moments of contemplation.",1

11596," Its elements are actually quite typical of a syndicated cartoon series, aimed mostly at the young'uns and contributing pretty much nothing to the Star Wars mythos.",0
214308," 'Queen of Katwe's a film that's thoughtful, charming, and heartwarming. It's nice to have sports heroes who are physically gifted, but it's nice to see a movie that celebrates a smart woman at the top of her game.",1
161773, Oddly a sports movie about baseball for eggheads and equally baseball for dummies. Which has as much on its mind literally as what's going down on the playing field - and may go a long way towards engaging both competitive sports couch potato audiences.,1
170964," Fizzling at the first, and limping to the last, this misfire is obsessed with ""assets"", yet squanders its own.",0

290472, A fitting end to the trilogy and a very good film.,1
13324, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore is an American comedy of the sort of vitality that dazzles European film critics and we take for granted.,1
127656, The strangest thing about [Marvel's] latest feature is that all of these characters come across utterly bored with their vocations.,0
193079, A succession of tepid gags tethered by a flimsy narrative.,0

42139,"A terrific cast, a gloomy tone and a few well-placed little bits of magic and real history bring a long-ago time and place to life.",1
136761," This extravagantly foul, outlandishly profane, howlingly funny comedy about a thieving, hard-drinking, child-loathing department store Santa is a shock to the yuletide system.",1

368514, If only it wasn't such bloody nonsense.,0
437859, Faults relies on awkward uncertainty to tell its tale and it's incredibly effective. Leland Orser and Mary Elizabeth Winstead are exceptional while the story is simple yet profound in execution. Faults is hypnotic in every sense of the word.,1
53490," It's a witty, appealing romantic comedy with a surprising edge, a cleverly written and deftly acted exploration of what happens when dreams appear to become reality, and the emotional stakes are raised. ",1
753,"To call the end result an absolute triumph would undercut more apropos labels; it seeks to be one of the best films of the year, and transcends that goal.",1

352339," Hess manages to both send up and pay tribute to the core conventions of romantic comedy, and for fans of the genre that is a very happy ending indeed.",1
5220,"Completing the tableau is the requisite whiff of Boy's Own Fascism, too diffuse to spoil our entertainment but tangible nevertheless.",1

309753, It delivers on the promise: it's simply a fun movie.,1
27025,McTeer's indomitable spirit towers over the movie.,1

91575," This pricey, juiceless pulp could never have been killed by critics, simply because it was already dead.",0
25774, Great junk like Resident Evil and passable schlock like 28 Weeks Later have more skill and integrity. Why would anyone want to make -- or watch -- this Hillcoat/McCarthy desolation except to feel fashionably cynical?,0
177502," It has cred to spare (see producer Peter Jackson, the writing team behind the Lord of the Rings films) but Mortal Engines is epically inert with a chasm between the money we see up on the screen and poverty of the story.",0
42765," The performance of Mark Duplass, who could be called Mr. Mumblecore for specializing in low-budget indies, is the reason to see this.",1
25375," An awkward screenplay by Andrew Matthews offers little feel for the way things actually work in Odisha... and given the picture's overall stiffness, Daniel seems lucky to have recruited actors with some experience as his leads.",0
423067, This pungent comedy set in combat's erogenous zone is Polanski at the top of his game.,1
38185," The film's commanding achievement is probably tonal: there is a warm, sensual flow to it, with production values that feel amorous and tactile.",0
266677, Even the title is lazy.,0
84720," Like Hepatitis B, this is one of those movies you just hope will go away.",0
416829," A gentle, fan-friendly Iggy Pop doc.",1
23467,"With its spirit of visual and narrative innovation, and Welles's precocious, towering central performance, Citizen Kane almost lives up to its own reputation as the best of all time.",1
285284," Takes the whole chick lit package, the candy colored dresses and the personal chauffeurs, to a ridiculous, intolerable new level.",0

337615," As action, as allegory, as cinema, The Hunger Games is the best American science-fiction film since The Matrix.",1
19479, rambling and far too long,0
101875," Too child-directed and broadly characterized; the commercial-minded, Disney-style high-stakes is a padding out of pondering-ness to ponderousness. This adaptation's more pose-y and cutesy than question-posing or poetically profound.",0

192569, The Bond films were bad enough even with the partially ironic performances of Connery.,0
155939," The best thing that can be said about ""The Bourne Legacy"" is that Renner will survive it.",0
285948, Too bad they couldn't figure out a way to make the whole movie invisible.,0
271020, It's not quite quick enough to be anywhere near as gloomily engaging as the cast's original outing.,0
19764," As the coffee-fueled Phil lurches further and further over the edge of soccer coach impropriety, you can sense Ferrell struggling to break through the lame script",0
120901, An enlivening and rather wickedly entertaining take on the occasional angels -- but mostly demons -- that ran the country into financial ruin.,1
51469," In Hannibal Rising, the bad Dr. Lecter finally enters the pantheon of movie monsters for real: Like Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees, he, too, now has a sequel that's been made strictly for the sake of a buck.",0
8973,[An] unimpressive outing from Zhang Yimou.,0

179671, A sad illustration of the decline in Hollywood screenwriting.,0
230017," 'Passengers' offers a tie between boring and absurd and a concept that must have been initiated on the heels of the huge success of 2013's ""Gravity."" Talk about giving new meaning to being lost in space.",0
288409," No matter how slick and questionably appropriate Morris's style may be, the content is compelling.",1
248354," It's not exactly a scary film, but it does provide an enjoyable ride. It's good fun. But it left me befuddled. A little sad. And a little angry.",1
371924," It's a quiet little gem about not taking family ties lightly, and just maybe, everything does happen for a reason. It's a sweet, poignant outing that may surprise you.",1
411191, Reese Witherspoon is miscast in this poor adaptation of the popular novel.,0
1832," If Part 2 was a clone of its predecessor, Part 3 is the genetic trash left over from trying to replicate the success of the first film.",0
437002," This account of Facebook's founder, and of the website's explosive growth, quickly lifts you to a state of exhilaration, and pretty much keeps you there for two hours.",1
338508," Formulaic, manipulative, hokey — and thoroughly rousing… the film's sincerity and poignance have a way of steamrolling over gaps in plausibility and logic.",1

37687," Those with the fortitude to relive the events of the morning of 9/11 should find the documentary ""Man in Red Bandana"" a powerful and inspiring experience.",1
119229," Can charitably be called a promising student movie, a thriller lacking nuance and suspense, a teasing tale with a long, long fuse and an underwhelming explanatory explosion for its finale.",0
294583," Sitting through this 111-minute debacle is akin to watching two amateur comics giving bad impersonations of De Niro and Pacino. Worse, actually; the comics would at least be funny.",0
319985, The International is just passable; it's a clock-puncher that's almost entirely free of suspense or surprise.,0

387674, Rourke is harrowing; Tomei is devastating.,1
73494, Little exceptional in this re-hash of genre clichés. ,0
350155," ...a cast composed of actors who are bad enough on their own, and who together amount to something unholy.",0
393161," There's delicious movie-movie elegance in the exotic locales and the period dress, but not much tension to be found in the murderous misadventures on offer.",0
419817," Arctic avoids existential symbolism for the sake of expressing authentic emotions, most of them thanks to Mads Mikkelsen's performance, a quiet tour de force.",1

415910," The performances are all very good indeed, and the film's serious, concerned tone suits the subject matter.",1
416343," Domhnall Gleeson and Margot Robbie make it entirely watchable, but the lack of complicated emotions means it's also completely forgettable.",0
303744," 'Inside Out' is original and inventive; it may not be a mind-blowing experience, but it is one of the best efforts from Pixar in several years.",1
387976," In his follow-up to Thumbsucker, writer-director Mike Mills continues to evoke a state of perpetual adolescence: the only fears given real weight are of not being liked and of having to behave like a responsible adult.",0
385880," Few things are as intolerable as schlock that takes itself seriously. Diary of the Dead, the latest zombie epic from George Romero, falls into that trap.",0
461347, Ugly is in the Eye of the Beholder.,0
7161,Gruesome yet imaginative teen psychosexual drama.,1
234217, 'Her' offers a mind-bending look at love and loneliness in the near future. ,1

321768," [D]espite the lovely Italian locales and a relatively appealing cast, the film is far too cloying for all but the most sentimental tastes.",0
73930, Delivers everything and more that fans of the first installment expect.,1
255241," This 1974 film stands as one of Fassbinder's sturdiest achievements, posed between the low-budget funkiness of his early features and the mannerism of his late period.",1
239683," While the story isn't particularly original, and the movie tends to drift over the top into broad slapstick, this comedy wins us over due to the camaraderie between the characters. ",1

244642, An immensely entertaining and seemingly acute chronicle of the week Diana died.,1
219763, Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price lacks the cinematic panache to elevate it above the level of agitprop. But its all too relevant dissection of its subject is well worth paying attention to.,1

36471,"Treads a fine line between wry satire, black comedy, and vaguely unsettling melodrama.",1

412360," The cynicism and fire of the film all emerges from the heat of Asia Argento. In giving a truly fearless performance as the title character, she uses her body and audacity to tweak the upper-class society that can't take their eyes off her.",1

122682," Schizophrenics, notes a psychiatrist in the movie, are pathologically incapable of recognizing the truth. If so, A Beautiful Mind is schizophrenic.",0
192783," Permission creates a compelling case study of adult relationships. With the direction of Crano he gives us a romantic drama that provides us with a heavy dose of romance, but also focuses on its decline.",1
349313," ...a yawner plot set-up that leads to lots of wannabe off-colour gags, a small army of pursuing villains and an expected final act in which Jason's icky-sticky niceness might perhaps stop McCarthy from being a shrieking psychopath.",0

152379," One insurmountable problem is that the stars, especially Ms. Olsen, 25, are too old for their roles. Another is that the movie has more characters than it can begin to accommodate in 91 minutes.",0
159832," Dazzling, scary and sentimental, Toy Story 3 is a daringly dark and emotional conclusion to the film series that made Pixar famous.",1
69385," While I felt the film did struggle with the emotional aspects of the storyline, I really can't find a film that was so effective in its portrayal of the personal experience of hurdling on the end of a rocket into space.",1
4474,"A trippy take on genetic engineering, Perfect is a mind-altering film that, depending on the viewer's sensibilities, will either be an expressionist gem or a hollow exercise in style over substance.",0
27043,"How can it be that this powerful, exciting, provocative movie has been all but overlooked this year?",1
110118, An unwise amalgam of Broadcast News and Vibes.,0

181140, A marginal improvement over its 1981 inspiration...,1
81551," Was it in Shannon's contract to have the same amount of screen time as the title character? Trouble is, he's as overdone as the product placements that are immune to the destruction.",1
358920," A dated, tired and underwritten fantasy; cosplay history with an onslaught of battle scenes.",0
20278," Ultimately, Lucy is solidly entertaining, though at times its leaps in logic feel a bit silly.",1
72294," Although it's very good at showing Jesus' suffering, the movie treats him as a prop",0

207534, Takes a painfully dark and tragic story and squanders it with emotional button-pushing movie formula.,0
254186," Dead Man Down's script falls prey to its own downward trajectory, its unwieldy array of cheap contrivances and half-witted switcheroos amounting to little more than a cut-rate riff on The Departed.",0
258367, Novices should prepare for mind-bending bloodshed and violence.,1
433383, A pretty good movie featuring a very good turn from Gere.,1
45451, The Final Girls trades in the slasher film staple of gore and wanton dismemberment for an unforced emotional depth that cuts deeper than any wound their killer could inflict.,1
246653, Hits the most predictable beats while hammering its way to a conclusion that's as egregiously contrived and corny as it is predictable.,0
397362, full review at Movies for the Masses,0
386347, The Great Wall proudly presents a barrage of battles you might want to see for the 3D... but there is nothing scary or striking about the movie itself.,0
168439," There are multiple pleasures to be had by witnessing a powerful, still-vital woman finding unexpected late-life joy of the platonic variety.",1
72185, All the action stuff is suitably epic and has seemingly been staged with criticisms of the other movies in mind.,1
1634, I enjoyed Scream 2.,1
76179," By the time it comes back to its bracketing device of police crime scene footage, Niespel, Bay and Kosar's movie has very much wasted its promising start and descended into a pointless exercise.",0
418356," Although it doesn't quite know how to round off its triptych of narratives, the film leaves you almost entirely sated, and invigorated by fresh and fantastical vistas too rarely visited by cinema outside the mind of Tim Burton.",1
65783," Lady Bird's unvarnished, unglamorized high-school drama has the quirky humor one expects from Gerwig...Ultimately, it's a mother-daughter love story, replete with the tribulations of painful individuation.",1
168807, This is technology with a heart and soul and used in a way that enhances the storytelling to create a grand family adventure.,1
17561,I am afraid I laughed from start to finish.,1
37495, To state that Hate Story 3 is a bad movie would be offensive to the very soul of bad movies.,0
261979," Carion has concocted a simple story for complex times, one that realistically examines the passing of the torch from a traditionalist to a neophyte",1
101110," It's a well-acted, fun, and zippy time at the movies.",1
150539, This French-language film is fiercely intellectual and thoughtful.,1
463002," Although the show is one I expected to hate, I fell for Ed and his band of idiots.",1
146585," While Firth dominates proceedings, appearing in every frame, he is nearly upstaged by debutant director's Ford's stunning cinematography, art direction and attention to detail.",1
111915, I think I speak for all adults and kids when I say I can't wait for playtime,1
233913," Expect to feel uncomfortable watching Diary of a Teenage Girl, which is precisely the point of this finely etched debut feature by writer/director Marielle Heller.",1
116577, [Director] Jon Poll... has trouble transitioning from humor to seriousness - and ends up mocking characters who need our sympathy the most.,0
238104," But with the help of Plummer's tremendous villain-autocrat performance, Ridley Scott gives us a very entertaining parable about money and what it can't buy.",1
264115," The work and mind of an architect come thrillingly to life in this smooth, intelligent doc about a certified modern genius.",1
117054, ... a half-hearted comedy about the perils of former professional athletes that unsuccessfully tries to force together elements of domestic melodrama and romantic farce.,0
198266," By trying to be contemporary, it loses the very qualities that have made it beloved in generations of nurseries.",0
4533,"Giant Little Ones doesn't exactly break the mold, but it certainly takes steps in that direction. Teenage audiences will likely find a lot to connect to in these characters, and in that way, the film has done its job.",0
261149, The 27-year-old filmmaker's command of film language is evident and his evocation of postwar trauma is haunting.,1

218616," It's hard to believe The Cakemaker is director and screenwriter Ofir Raul Graizer's first feature, it is such an assured, well-judged and sweetly moving study of a gay man's journey through grief and loneliness. ",1
108372, Million Dollar Baby is one for the books. It could have gone wrong in ways that would reduce it to a series of stereotypes. But it never does.,1
101372," The plot with its themes of revenge, honour and power might be a bit everywhere, but there is much to enjoy with this wild, theatrical joyride from Rodriguez, whose enthusiasm is infectious",1
279612," Although I laughed at a couple of slapstick gags, the rest of this comedy didn't seem very funny to me.",0
46499,Awe and admiration.,1
305487, A slightly flawed film that will nevertheless give fans of the comic book and first film a plenty good buzz.,1
185609," It's a reasonably engaging movie, but based on very familiar filmic archetypes.",1
314678, A so-so idea and a good cast squandered on an eight-figure scramble of the movies and books of which writer-director Drew Pearce is fond. It's depressing to see so little of Jodie Foster anymore. Why does she keep making dunderheaded dystopian duds?,0
190694," The result asserts the two-headed truism: Artists in many countries will always find grim, sometimes deadly opposition, and those same artists will continue to risk everything to remain alive inside.",1
10272,"The movie is well-made and likable, without any major missteps. It's also just a little bland.",1
64441," Like its predecessor, it's a one-joke movie; the difference is that this time around, the joke is better.",1
471535," Alvarez's Evil Dead left many wondering what this visually talented director would do next. Inconsistent and offensive, Don't Breathe is not the follow-up many will have wanted.",0
3942,...a decent little horror flick...,1

412," A grand adventure, thrillingly told.",1
258482, The story moves forward at a brisk pace and there's enough element of surprise and suspense in Bhaagamathie.,1
65051," It's a thoroughly obnoxious piece of work that's nonetheless winning in its boorishness, which is precisely the tone Law is trying to strike [...]",1
256615," It's a beautiful, vibrant story about memories, the passing of time and how you treat the people in your life.",1
107920," While not a terrible film, Captain America lacks the edge necessary to truly capture viewers' imagination.",0
25663, There is life after Disney,1
364121," Park’s skills for surreal subjectivity and the mischievously weird certainly don’t hurt, but they can’t quite banish Stoker’s narrative speed bumps and draughts of cold air...",1
180112," As much a knockabout comedy -- the almost skeletal Bale performs with the goofy, loose-limbed exuberance of the young Jerry Lewis -- as a traditional boxing movie or inspirational drama of overcoming addiction.",1
265022," Even for the third entry in a family franchise, the construction is lazy to the point of indifference. ",0

122041," Even if it doesn't quite fulfill its potential, Miss Bala is interesting enough to make it worth at least a DVD or VOD rental.",0
15026,Far from captivating.,0
57582," Jarring moments, coupled with the fact the movie simply isn't that funny, make for an uneven viewing experience that is best done while couching out at home. ",0
155847," The TV show created an incredibly complex world over three seasons. This picture (the first in a proposed trilogy) tries to accomplish a year's worth of work in two hours. So we get titles and flashbacks, baldly expository dialogue and clumsy narration.",0
45287,It's a great American story.,1
3471," Because the performances are so calculated, the emotional outbursts on which the story hinges fail to make a dramatic impact. And for a film about a novelist, The Wife conveys very little sense of what it's like to read or write.",0
36672,"While we can still marvel at the amazing sights laid out before us, it is imperative that we never lose sight of who's who and what's at stake. That turns out to be a tall order.",1

390597," O brother Cianfrance, where art thou? Maybe next time.",0
280662," If the blogosphere makes hay from the fact that Radcliffe goes beyond first base in this film, the robotic storytelling will deflate any curiosity.",0
316423," It's this fact that makes Brooklyn so relevant. As our country debates whether to allow refugees in, we need to reflect upon our own histories and recognize so many common dreams and goals. We're all Eilis. ",1
38947,"Unlike the geisha, this adaptation does wear its heart on its sleeve, but a fine cast, including the regal Michelle Yeoh, create a picture of composure.",1
381010, The Answer Man is one of those modestly diverting motion pictures that's as sweet as cotton candy -- and as insubstantial.,0
4472,"With the unwavering assurance of a seasoned veteran at the top of his form, visionary director Clint Eastwood scores again with this brilliant, powerful, compelling underdog story.",1

459922, ...so overstuffed with heavy themes and convoluted plot lines that it barely manages to squeeze in the requisite gags about canine flatulence.,0
394211, A hardworking screwball comedy that plays like a warmed-over Woody Allen fluffernutter.,0
56968," Slow and listless, lacking tension or a sense of danger, it's a pastiche with aspirations to being a movie that ends up a very expensive pageant.",0
333145," Not consistent enough in its lore to merit much conversation, not gory enough to appall, not titillating, not scary, not exciting, a little too long. . .",0
224568," ""45 Years"" is a movie about intuition and inner lives, and you have to look fast to catch all its resonances.",1
12661," Maybe [Adam] Green intended to parody how low-rent and awful slasher sequels usually are. If so, the joke's on his audience.",0
16660, Beautiful writing and superb acting show us why Stan (Steve Coogan) and Ollie (John C. Reilly) loved each other.,1
309059," Too abstract to suggest a coherent moral lesson, but too remote to foster a satisfying emotional connection, Womb feels barren, an attempt to do too much that ultimately does very little.",0
32550,It's Romero doing what he does best: using zombies to create a lowbrow social parable.,1
36600,"If Cecil B. DeMille were alive today and given the chance to direct a special effects-laden fantasy adventure on Mars, he might have made something similar to Andrew Stanton's visually stunning epic ""John Carter.",1
219130, A comedy that strains so hard to be edgy it nearly pulls a muscle.,0
24164,There's so little to go wrong that those who like their entertainment mindless and violent will find little fault.,1
412978, Mostly an excuse for cramming as much gratuitous violence as possible into a PG-13-rated flick running only 92 minutes.,0

419098, Classic holiday movie for the whole family.,1
388136," Eastwood displays the futility of the Iraq war, but, given more than 10 years of films with the same ideas and images, it's not a startling or even moving message. ",0

4049,"Alita: Battle Angel is worth your penny if you are looking for a good, action-packed, entertaining spectacle.",1
2828," Pretty much perfect...No one now, and maybe no one ever, is as good with the big wince as Kristen Wiig.",1
54587," Willis appears to be doing little more than going through the motions, and the character is so gutted and generic at this point that virtually any other action caricature could be inserted into the script with virtually no effect on the film",0
5257,"The film has some intriguing characters, subplots, situations. Frustratingly, though, the complete jigsaw doesn't fit together, hampered by plot implausibilities and unrealities.",0
55882, One of my favorite Marvel movies ever. ,1
212316, There's something undeniably compelling about the cast's daringly go-for-broke performances... but Daniels fragments the narrative and throws in so many tricksy directorial touches that the whole thing becomes an annoyingly indulgent mess.,0
19531," The film's American heroes are depicted as pig-headed, offensive bullies who claim the moral high ground but in the end can solve their problems only with guns and car chases.",0
92846," Warm Bodies has elements of true inspiration, but the whole is slightly underwhelming.",0
271352, The crisp photography makes the movie what it is. The camera catches the beauty and devastation of each scene with a sharpness that rivals the greatest works in cinema history,1
280354," [Some will] wonder how I could bash a story so ""touching,"" so ""humane,"" so ""heartwarming."" One word: manipulation.",0
84652," While this film fails to break the typical Hollywood mold, it is still entertaining enough in a wish fulfillment fantasy kind of way.",1
275151, A worthy addition to the neo-noir canon.,1
475550," Oh, it's a punisher all right.",0
268244, It's a one-joke scenario that raises only the odd wry smile while the thin story struggles to reveal or say anything of significance.,0
333874," ""Kingsman"" is like a high-speed collision between a Jaguar and a jaywalking soccer hooligan. It's ridiculously out of balance, and when you're stuck in the middle, it doesn't seem so funny.",0
129511, The biggest bummer about Suicide Squad is that its ads promised something different from the other too-many-superheroes-crammed-in-one-movie movies. What it delivers is yet another film overflowing with superheroes we barely get to know.,0
288755, A failed experiment.,0
351483, ... perfectly watchable drama that benefits substantially from the stellar efforts of its two stars.,1
8507," If some of the movie's effects are distractingly shoddy (see: the unconvincing dancing donkey), Thompson is rather divine. ",1

231843," This one is a few bits funnier than Malle's dud, if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like Slob City reductions of Damon Runyon crooks.",0

141085," With beautiful visuals and a sense of fun, director Kenneth Branagh has crafted a fetching, playful delight.",1

198099," Wrestling with Angels is personal and intimate, insightful about Kushner as well as instructive about his collection of works.",1
349963," a well-made film featuring good actors and which tells an intimate story, but which tries to do too much and collapses under the weight of its own aspirations",0
266726," My interest waxed and waned. The set up for the film seemed to take eons. Frank overstuffed the script with exposition, multiple subplots and some seemingly unnecessary sequences. Just as I was ready to dismiss the movie, he switched gears.",0

433740," It's smart, sexy and moderately amusing.",1
81200, This attempt at reviving the erotic thriller (not to mention Katherine Heigl's career) is a missed opportunity all around.,0

263818," Dance truly is a kind of miracle, isn't it?",1
204036," A girl-on-girl werewolf flick may sound similar to a plot line for the ultimate guilty pleasure horror flick, but in reality Jack and Diane may be just a little too John-Mellan-campy for most viewers' tastes.",0
285610," Rahul Bose has a winning presence -- eager with a touch of wariness or wary with a touch of eagerness, and never entirely at home. He keeps the movie from seeming too comfy -- a good thing.",1

382019," Perhaps not every section works. But Waru lingers, disquietingly, in the mind.",1
207587, This distinctive character is gradually subsumed by familiar genre imperatives that eventually make McCall seem less special and singular than he did on first exposure in 2014.,0
4297, Marginal special effects and a heavy-handed dead-end plot ... space trash.,0
119742," This is the first Scary Movie in seven years, but the formula remains unchanged, with a thin storyline linking spoofs of Hollywood hits.",0
87415," Intends to be a character study, a serious exploration of who this biblical icon might have been, but it also packs on the CGI-heavy combat and tired characterizations.",0

48293,"Peter Weir makes this wartime tale a sleek, rousing, old-fashioned adventure instead of a somber, self-important epic slog. ",1
176246," A screwball hit-man comedy in the Grosse Pointe universe, it's like what you'd get if Nora Ephron wrote True Lies while high.",1
19033," The movie ought to be scarier, but in the current genre environment of teen-centric, found-footage shockers, its messing-with-Mother Nature traditionalism and structured storytelling is so old-school it feels new again.",1

402393," Unfortunately, Fincher doesn't add much to Niels Arden Oplev's Swedish version: more Googling and plot-compressing montages and an altered but still convoluted ending.",0
73847," The Lady in the Van is a delicate little piece, one that could so easily be overdone. Thankfully, Bennett, Hytner and, of course, the incomparable Dame Maggie refuse to turn the film into the expected Best Marigold Hotel mush.",0
283037, Tarantino's signature nastiness and his juvenile delight in shocking the audience undercut the movie's larger purpose.,1
