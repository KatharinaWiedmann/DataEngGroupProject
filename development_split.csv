151680," Solid performances, but the screenplay is a clunky, contrived and stilted mess.",0
189,"Don't think too hard about the plot twists or the rules of Frank's universe, because it will all fall apart. Just buy the ticket, sit back, and enjoy the ride.",1

317,"One of those properties that works no matter the format whether a series movie or its latest iteration, a stop-motion animated movie, that's worthy of two snaps up.",1
386752, A relentlessly immersive tour de force.,1
41585,"Many of The To Do List's jokes have this first-draft, is-that-all-there-is? quality.",0
25207,"The key to the film's success is its lack of strain. As written by Jose Rivera and Tim Sullivan, this isn't one of those pushy slapstick affairs; it's more romantic than comic, and despite the corn there are no villains.",1
