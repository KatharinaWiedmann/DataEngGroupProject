386752, A relentlessly immersive tour de force.,1
41585,"Many of The To Do List's jokes have this first-draft, is-that-all-there-is? quality.",0
25207,"The key to the film's success is its lack of strain. As written by Jose Rivera and Tim Sullivan, this isn't one of those pushy slapstick affairs; it's more romantic than comic, and despite the corn there are no villains.",1
