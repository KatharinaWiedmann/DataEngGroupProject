2507,"""Echo in the Canyon"" works more as a fond tribute than the kind of documentary that breaks new ground, but it's hard to imagine anyone being disappointed by the results.",1
8332,"After a series of prolonged climaxes, with its potential victims staring directly into the camera and shaking with fright, the ""Unknown"" finally emerges as a type of rolling rubber mattress, disappointingly unhorrific in content and appearance.",0
209703, You'll feel the cold on the Hoth-like ice planet. It's pure movie magic -- impressive and astonishing and deserving of all the out-of-this-world hyperbole. Too bad the rest of it is mostly empty space.,1

16642,"Please, Hollywood, no more inspiration, particularly if it feels about as authentic as canned laughter.",0
2842,"A surfeit of plot succeeds only in confusing the story, not complicating it in the kind of way that might have made its big twist the sort of jaw-dropping revelation it clearly wants to be.",0
