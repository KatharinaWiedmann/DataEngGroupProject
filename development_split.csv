18134,An enjoyable campy bad film.,0
3215,"This brave little film, a tale of an uncomprehending hero whose every step seemingly is a misstep, is not unlike the best offerings of Italian neorealism of the post-war years.",1
222,"Excellent, accurate, smart analysis of sexual harrassment in the workplace.",1

1563,"The chemistry between the main trio is very pleasant, which is what hooks you, since you will empathize immediately with these kids. [Full Review in Spanish]",1
654,"An engaging personal essay documentary about not having children, complete with interviews, arguments, hard data and sound reasoning coming from both sides of the debate",1
428143," If nothing else, The Wolverine proves how charismatic Jackman is. Because the star, far more than the stunts and the illogical script, is the reason to see this X-Men spinoff.",1

3024,"Moments of hilarity remain, and the picture is inventive in its adoration for the excesses of the genre and the world of VHS recording.",1
183799," [Mitchell's] giddy, knowingly camp direction has a sort of glitter-stick DIY spirit that keeps the movie aloft long after the story itself has run out of road.",1

31256,"One of Luis Bunuel's greatest and funniest films, and the winner of a Best Foreign Film Oscar, The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie is a brilliant surrealistic joke about a group of friends whose attempts to dine are continually thwarted.",1
30934,A romantic comedy that is neither romantic nor particularly funny.,0

4244,"""One"" isn't out for blood, electing to care for Wyman's legacy, receiving an enviable opportunity to pore through the musician's treasures.",1
312,"""Inherit the Viper"" isn't surprising, but it's accomplished, getting into the muck of criminal activity without losing focus on the human price of such survival instincts.",1
83602," Mr. Irving remains a disturbingly facile spinner of yarns in which the most sordid facts of life are glossed over into comfortably didactic homilies about the innate goodness of people. Yet, I was somehow moved...",1
571,"Not the worst adventure flick that I've ever seen, but far from a great one either.",0
397377," If the historical context for black anger is lacking, Jacobs nonetheless builds tension with excruciating effectiveness and dreamlike detachment.",1

4968,"Isn't It Romantic is a fun and enjoyable romantic comedy, especially perfect for a girl's night out. The strong work of its performers, combined with some fascinating world building makes the movie a must-see for fans of the sub-genre.",1
25634,Kate Hudson's impressive comic flair almost saves this implausible romantic comedy.,0
53283,"If Matchstick Men isn't the classic con The Sting was, it still empties our pockets with the fast hands of a master.",1
451344, Martel creates a cinema of dialectical tensions; the bustling activity of offices and drawing rooms veers outside the frame while voices of authority and complaint assail the hero with a bewildering tangle of conflicting demands and desires.,1
2108,"Except for the five-star chemistry between the pair, Stuber ends up mostly a middling ride.",0
401283, Too much of it seems strained and overly familiar.,0
217432," A movie about teenage taggers in the Bronx should be fast and raw, scruffy and loose, and Adam Leon's Gimme the Loot is just that.",1
382961," Still one of the creepiest, scariest, most shocking films ever.",1
2178,"Jamie Bell gives a pulsating performance in Skin as an American neo-Nazi who renounces all notions of white supremacy, to the vengeful fury of his former associates.",1
445885," Sacrifices credibility not only by the fact that it was co-directed and co-written by the obviously partisan Harry Thomason (along with Nickolas Perry), but also because of its cheesy cinematic style.",0
3807,"What could have been a feeble attempt to ride on the coattails of Donnie Yen's franchise turns out to be an exhilarating, tightly paced, expertly-crafted martial arts romp.",1

5530,"Room for Rent has all the right pieces to be a great thriller, but it fails to deliver on its promise.",1
28953," Superbly directed, powerfully emotional documentary that presents a convincing case against keeping orca whales in captivity and is liable to induce righteous anger at the behaviour of a certain marine park.",1

1909,"Full of explosive set pieces, bloody battles, and quips aplenty... offers plenty for fans looking to see the Firefly family in full chaotic mode.",1
2145,"It's all a very heady stew, and the fact that this is just the beginning sometimes makes it feel like a slog. Yet there are moments that shine so bright - where you see what Wang is working at - that they make the film hum.",1
39666," Everyone has a favorite Tommy Lee Jones performance. Until now I didn't have my least favorite, but ""The Homesman"" provides it, and is ruined by it.",0

3687,"The way Long Shot differentiates itself from the sexist sitcom cliche is by exploring the difficulty men have in ceding power to women, even if-perhaps especially if-the women are clearly more skilled and intelligent.",1
401371," Watching people land on the moon isn't all that interesting or photogenic, especially when we know it's pretend.",0

410095, The numbness of sitting through nearly two hours of dreck isn't all that kills the momentum going in to Death Proof.,0
54769, Director Sanford struggles in vain to put a shiny new wrapper on this secondhand offering.,0
3044,"The creation of the Oxford English Dictionary might not instantly sound like the basis for much of a movie, yet the combination of Mel Gibson and Sean Penn with a pretty compelling historical backstory ends up delivering a solid historical drama.",1
1442,Bloody Marie falls short on almost every front. Marie herself is an unlikeable mess of a character who only amounts to be the centrepiece of a film that was never fully realised as the thrill-ride it was supposed to be.,0
7308,The Old West apparently offered too many outhouses and too much horse manure for MacFarlane to resist over-mining that particular vein.,0
2777,"As someone who is always up for more clown-based horror hijinks, Gags feels like something of a letdown; there is a genuinely good idea at its core, but his approach never really works for me as a viewer.",0
5464,"The most interesting thing about the film, directed by Joe Berlinger, is that the story is told from the perspective of Liz Kendall. [Full Review in Spanish]",1
399456," I don't want to come down too hard on ""The Signal"" because while I don't think that it ultimately works in the end, it is far more ambitious in both concept and execution than the majority of contemporary American horror efforts",0

5242,"Just like the world could always use a few more kind-hearted people looking to make a difference, we can definitely use more movies like Good Sam.",1
114783," Director Reichardt appears to owe a debt to the Dardenne brothers' similarly themed, Palme d'or-winning Rosetta, getting her intense effects from the point-of-view camera as much as from Williams's strong performance.",1
1829,"If there's one reason why you should see this film, it's to admire the wonderful performances from Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence.",1
9477," Underneath the silly carnage, there's a tremendously fun film, but as a starting point, it signals the start of a potentially big new franchise.",1
254067, Lacks the tension and wow-factor we've grown accustomed to from slick star vehicles.,0
293398," Watterson appears to have put most of his energy into crafty art direction and practical effects, sorely neglecting story and character development...might elicit a few giggles, but its padded 80 minute running time becomes an endurance test.",0
518,"Countdown has jump scares galore, but that doesn't mean it's good.",0
1642,"Even with the occasional dollop of dog-related humor, The Art of Racing in the Rain feels as ponderous as its title.",0
30710,Must Love Dogs is the kind of film that benefits far too much from its very talented veteran cast.,0
1496,"The movie is silly and the humour hardly elegant, but it manages to draw laughs anyway. The plot is unquestionably simple, yet there are parts that are wildly imaginative and enjoyable.",1
6906," This problem of truth -- how it might be defined, known, or told -- underlies most all of Mel Gibson's film.",0

4796,Of little use to the film is the beauty of its frames in exteriors and interiors. [Full Frame in Spanish],0
3581,"It's a layered, rooted, and just-left-of-symmetrical picture that allows viewers to fill in as much or as little of everyone's history as they'd like.",1
368522," A molasses-paced flick which rings false from beginning to end, from its patently absurd premise clear through to its unintentionally funny resolution.",0
144008," Joffe and his screenwriter Larry Cohen deserve a little credit for pointing up the psychological horrors where they can, but Captivity is still a grubby, exploitative film with an extremely guessable twist and universally dull performances.",0
116505, Disturbing and distinctly pre-#MetToo in its creepy engagement with the sexual abuse subject matter,1
309227, The only thing which would make this film more awkward is watching it with your parents.,0
47887,What in lesser hands could have become an immaculately observed period piece instead soars to creative heights with its literate and knowing script.,1
826,Lobs more cinema war cliches than grenades.,0
26606," While bewildering for those unfamiliar with the Judd Apatow clan, for fans, this raunchy, daring and gleeful comedy comes up trumps.",1
26363,"One of the great coming-of-age movies, and also one of the great movies of teasing courtship",1
158639," A perfectly funny, sharply written movie that's ultimately empty, where its only apparent goal was to remind you of other movies. ",0
462140, Triple 9 unfolds in a hyper-masculine haze that's more conducive to adrenaline-rush action and a pervasive sense of tension than it is to narrative clarity. ,1
404236," Resonating with Rat Pack ring-a-ding-ding, it's a silly sequel but, considering star value alone, it should sell a lot of popcorn.",0
52187,A real missed opportunity - a potentially groundbreaking film reduced to a mess fit only for the slack-jawed mallrats that it is being aimed...,0
2431,The hyper-stylized world [Joseph] Kahn creates has an artistry that barrels its way into the social consciousness in a manner that few films would ever attempt.,1
2708,"Turner delivers a solid performance as a young woman coming to grips with an unknown force, and James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender maintain the frenemy bond we've grown to love.",1
118200," There's a great movie in Fateless, but it's the second half of a double-feature. And the first feature is one we've seen before.",0
367,"It's very predictable, everything is just boring, the jokes don't land as well.",0
4829,"There are some good moments and interesting ideas but it largely feels rushed, blunt and is highly derivative.",0
7819,"Julia Roberts continues to be one of our finest actresses, and she makes this film less tedious than it could have been. ",0
16285,Tres Greek writer and star Nia Vardalos has crafted here a worldly-wise and very funny script.,1
219,'Miss Americana' offers a compelling and compassionate portrait of an extraordinarily talented woman who has grown up and remained remarkably unspoiled under the harshest possible spotlights.,1
47404,"Retains the Coen brothers' trademark quirkiness, and it certainly goes all out. But it's also subtle in ways we haven't seen before.",1
22097,"The gap between the first and second installments isn't as gaping as with, for instance, Analyze This and Analyze That, but the laughs Fockers generates are the type you feel embarrassed about almost immediately afterward.",0

55500, It's all too ridiculous for even the make-believe world of movies.,0
2492,"The lead performances carry the film, and the soundtrack is sure to sell well. With some more plot discipline, though, it's hard to shake the feeling WILD ROSE couldn't have been so much more.",0
4425,Shambolic rambunctious and fun.,1
4224,"Performances alone cannot save an uninspired script. The story is not bad per se, but it's not original or inspired and therefore Making Babies wallows in mediocrity.",0
383,"[A] funny, inventive, scary film.",1
4324,"Just as [Aziz Ansari's] actions caused me to look inward, 'Right Now' has the same effect. Ansari wants people to do what the title of his special suggests: Look at who you are right now and how you live right now. It's an impressive analysis of humanity.",1
4664,"Perry seems eager to put the character behind him, and A Madea Family Funeral reflects that general sense of ennui.",0
326806," A highly enjoyable film, but a little less noise and a little more humanity would have made it a better one.",1
1530,This is a degrading movie for everyone involved with it. So badly written and executed it almost feels offensive for the culture it portrays. [Full review in Spanish}.,0
54520, You'll probably walk out wishing the Hughes brothers disappeared for another nine years.,0
2429,"Bodied is probably not for most audiences, but those who like their humor to be both crude and knowing will likely have as much fun watching it as I did.",1
14158,"Here, while the routines are as polished as ever, everything else is tired, not least Fat Amy's fat jokes. Time for a new song, ladies.",0
419021," As a long time fan, I would have appreciated perhaps another story than the recycled one offered here, but it is still nice to see all the old friends back.",1
118139, Villeneuve has failed to deliver anything near the emotional intensity of his previous work and the ever-dependable Adams can't save the film from some ponderous sci-fi noodling.,0
247839," The plot here is so threadbare and the characters so badly developed (or in a couple of cases, completely undeveloped) that both begin to fade from memory as soon as the film is over.",0
2267,"Taking such a granular approach to the work provides real detail to ""Alien,"" but also reveals some shortcomings.",1
288513," Terrible in pretty much every way, and a complete waste of time. But what makes it even worse is that it tries so hard to be taken seriously.",0

3347,"Albeit no cinematic achievement, The VelociPastor is a hysterically ludicrous horror-comedy that knows its absurdity and has no qualms inviting you in.",0
4840,"I want more of this. I specifically want more animated Ninja Turtles...it allows them to do more mature things, or something edgier.",1
96119, Irritatingly elusive thanks to an undercooked script and slack editing.,0
234690," ...few fans of the original are likely to be truly disappointed, and the film is certainly in the top tier of the studio's output. It's just a shame that it doesn't quite have the same beating heart as its predecessor. ",1
4092,An enjoyable but innocuous genre exercise which mostly misses the book's emotional weight.,1
1969,"It's clever and cute and never lets you forget it, winning in spite of how much it insists on it.",1
34692,"Director Brian Robbins is no John Hughes, though he does strive for 'message movie' status.",0
4323,"Over the course of the special, Ansari hits many more predictable-feeling beats.",1
2972,Ignore the film's marketing materials. This thriller has more to offer than empty calorie scares.,1
4827,"No amount of mutilation can disguise the fact that this is from the sick, brilliant mind that brought us Carrie, Blow Out and Body Double.",1
316263," Religulous is no model for journalistic excellence, but it probably needn't be. It is more an opportunity for Maher to showcase his competent comic delivery than to win hearts and minds.",0
4341,Enjoyable film.,1
27634," There is a comic-book devouring, Playboy-stashing adolescent male heart thumping rather sweetly at the core of this homage-spoof.",1
13194,Constant fuchsia lighting can't make this setup warm.,0

620,[The filmmakers are] bound to [its] shortcomings because the text's drama is born solely from James' fear while everyone [else] distracts from the redundancy of that truth.,0
26410,... it's a beautiful coming-of-age story that hasn't been told before.,1
35,"Adle Haenel's efforts... do not prevent the absolute artistic shipwreck of the film, in the same way that this will not prevent a more than predictable success at the box office. [Full review in Spanish]",0

53467,"It's about taking a complete leap of faith toward life-altering changes, a running theme in all the director's movies.",1
16130,"To those of us on the greying side of five years old, Barney looks like an eggplant and has a rigor-mortis smile, no shoulders, a huge rear end and the sort of nervous giggle that makes you think he has something to hide.",0

28846,A powerful though overwrought study of bigotry and fear.,1
250795," I am a sucker for these kinds of big, dumb action movies (I liked ""John Carter"" and ""The Green Lantern"" too), particularly if they have a good deal of science fiction in them, and this one does.",1
78063, This isn't a particularly original work of cinema but the duo front and center carry the tradition of the buddy action flick across the finish line with a number of laughs and thrilling action scenes along the way.,1
421429," On its own, the Greendale film is tough to navigate, especially for those who haven't heard the accompanying album or seen the Greendale concert.",0

36755,"Though ambitiously mounted and sporadically enthralling, the live-action debut of Pixar filmmaker Andrew Stanton is a sci-fi spectacle that's just not very spectacular.",0
14505,"It's up to us to decide Kennedy's guilt. But, also, to sympathize with his shame.",1
8780," Filmworker is a portrait of an unsung hero, a revealing look at how Kubrick's films were made and a psychological sketch of a would-be Da Vinci determined to keep dusting and polishing someone else's Sistine Chapel.",1
170708," On paper this had ""belter"" written all over it. Sadly, Damon's lifeless performance in the lead role failed to keep me gripped throughout the movie's bum-numbing 167 minutes.",1

46363," The storytelling isn't as tight as it could be, and it isn't very inspired or ambitious, and I can't say I felt much emotional investment.... But it has enough laughs, heart, and entertaining creatures to amuse your own little monsters.",1
533,This is honestly one of the most offensive movies I've ever seen in my entire life.,0
136791," Muntean's fourth feature is unrelentingly mundane, as if made with the sole purpose of draining the topic of adultery of any prurient interest, the kisses accompanied by smacking sounds to smother any erotic response.",0
81637," We are introduced to the alchemists who looked at a talented little kid, saw dollar signs, and turned him into pure gold. Somehow, director Jon Chu is able to make their success not seem exploitative.",1
