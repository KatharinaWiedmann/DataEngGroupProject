36362,The first feature from the creators of Wallace and Gromit is a plucking good time.,1
7981,Misses the sense of menace that it requires.,0

296687," Cusack, who self-deprecatingly mocks his iconic presence in '80s films like Say Anything, is terrific -- with an especially wonderful, demented monologue in which he explains why he and his sister are so screwed up.",1
176770, Knightley's Sugar Plum cannot elevate an entire movie on her translucent wings. The flick's promise is quickly drowned in its artificial simulation of emotions.,0
2104," Best of all is Parker, the perfect melancholy romantic hero, brooding and dark, yet touching and sentimental.",1
2736,"None of the filmmaking or acting really conveys that wonder of discovery; of falling in love. It's a facsimile of that feeling; a not-so-cheap copy. And, weirdly enough, it inspired in me only a small sense of loneliness.",0

38621,"As for the space stuff, well, George Lucas need not lose any sleep.",0

1405,"The deliberately paced film is slight but heartfelt, with endearing performances.",1
45343,"[Turing is] a puzzle, yes, but to its credit, The Imitation Game doesn't pretend to solve him.",1
915,"This is basically a high-toned soap opera, but it is not overly serious. It is largely a comedy of manners. There is plenty of humor and high spirits in this story and the acting is excellent. The production values are first-rate.",1
1240,After the Wedding is one of those thoroughly inessential yet subtle and well-crafted films made for grown-ups who like sitting back and watching the inner turmoil of other grown-ups.,1
54101,There are six writers and eight producers listed in the credits. Is it any wonder that it feels like an amalgamation of mismatched bits and pieces?,0
4392,"Though it relies on all the typical clichs, in the end it convincingly portrays the band as real people, who care about each other and draw strength from the bonds of friendship and family.",1
2735,"""Aladdin"" delivers the goods, especially when the music is playing, and while it may not be exactly what you wished for, it's close enough.",1
4601,The Edge of Democracy is easily one of the great works of documentary this year. It is a riveting experience; an impeccably edited navigation of Brazil's volatile relationship with democracy...,1
229941," Despite [The Cove's] special pleading, it's unclear why these (admittedly beautiful and interesting) creatures should be treated any differently from cows.",0
26278,"Call Me By Your Name survives because of poignant screenwriting, keen directing, and tender acting.",1
747,"It's confusing in tone, though very funny at times, especially coming from Cooper and Lawrence, but by the end, Russell feels he's warranted an emotional reaction from the audience when he's done anything but. ",0

31408,"In the chick-flick world, hell is other women, and here specifically it's the stay-at-home wife and mother.",0
3117,The lead actresses are both solid but the direction by Trevor Nunn is dull.,0
28526,"It's all fight scenes, and the fight scenes have no arc. You just sit there waiting for some inevitable deus ex machina to save the day whenever Peter Jackson feels like it. The characters have no agency. It's like watching a kid play with his GI Joes.",0
32181,"Apparently, Schrader never intended to make a horror movie, much to the dismay of the studio.",1
4628,"Captain Marvel is an enjoyable escapist movie that happens to check all the boxes for a modern progressive audience and delivers humor and action in an easy to watch, slickly-made package that maybe even the fanboys might like.",1
26586,It's a shame there isn't a good movie deep down in this excuse for gore and sadism.,0
73,37 Seconds is as entertaining as it is important.,1
226443, Your Name. is an engaging if saccharine universal tale of self-discovery. It's also a visual masterwork.,1
5182,"This seems like one of those films where everyone got in a room with a rough idea of what was happening and ad-libbed, expecting the results to be natural cohesive comedy genius.",1
465,"Adam Devine is more enjoyable in small doses - like supporting roles and not leading the charge. Michael Pena, we feel your pain. Come back, all is forgiven - this, Dora, everything!",0
32158,"The folksy shenanigans are well-intentioned but frankly interminable, with Kline's wry efficiency the best relief from all the yowling and whining.",0
39416,"Too compromised to be more than a reasonably pleasurable entertainment, as if it is scared about what it is saying about the American political process.",0
18552,"It's good how they bring the characters back, however, it's not enough to keep our eyes on the screen and not the clock. [Full review in Spanish]",0
47596,"In a sense, the film is a lament for old certainties which are cruelly swept aside, perhaps purged would be more accurate, by Bardem's extraordinary monster.",1
46665," ""Given the vintage alt-culture vibe, you'd swear this blast of Hot Topic Cinema had been spat out of a time machine.""",0
6938,A desperately unfunny mix of romantic and gross-out comedy.,0
355,The moment they put two men on Mistress of Evil's screenplay was the moment it was doomed.,0
3599,"This movie is so charming, smart, and funny... This movie full of quirky people ultimately got me.",0
239433," Dark and twisted but without the depth to back it up, Pietà is determined to provoke controversy at the expense of characterisation.",0
9714,"More a specialist in sarcasm than in melodrama, Roos fails to scare up a decent complete exchange between anybody.",0
2556,Coming-of-age comedy about feeling different; mild cursing.,1
5747,"Blending elements of crime-thriller and revisionist Western, Blood on Her Name delivers a uniquely exciting experience.",1
1392,"Nicolas Un-Caged - that's what you could call this man versus nature actioner. Nicolas Cage returns to his action roots with Primal, a high octane action film which takes subtlety and tosses it overboard.",1
49919,Typical innocuous Elvis vehicle that might be brainless but at least is pleasant.,0
402,"As slow and meandering as the film feels at times, DP José Luis Alcaine's eye is a constant that enlivens the screen when the narrative struggles to.",1
364746," When Disney attempts to flip its own script, and shorten the princess's nap, and give us a frankly charisma-free prince, it all plays off as apologism. ",1
53145,This is a movie about con games at every level.,1
207287," The Girl with All the Gifts, adapted from the novel by M. R. Carey, is an effective, scary, and emotional zombie movie.",1

4344,"A gripping, moving, sobering and highly entertaining film",1
102432," As show biz documentaries go, this one is a must-see.",1
3799,"The plentiful fight scenes are executed with precision and the occasional ""wire-fu"" flourish by legendary action director Yuen Wo-Ping, with a showdown between gun and wing-chun fist among the more inventive touches.",1
45165,More action-filled and tense than The Bourne Identity.,1
269162," Protagonists Jacob and Anna are no Romeo and Juliet, despite writer/director Drake Doremus' fraudulent but manful attempts to make them seem so -- at the end of the day, their problems could be solved by a plane ticket and less self-involvement.",0
165353," A fun, affectionate tribute to b-movie creature features. ",1

379228, The first guilty pleasure of 2007.,1
50039,"Filled with fancy, if frenetic footwork but weighed down by all-too-familiar plot/characters/dialogue.",0
3879,"Maron plays his strength as another grouch with a heart of gold, and the whole cast has nice chemistry with each other.",1
39029,"Memoirs of a Geisha is worthwhile on many levels, although it lacks the depth of feeling that would have elevated it from a good movie to a romance for the ages.",1
31341,This story is best left on the page.,0
12704," There's the music, of course. Nothing touches that. But despite the personal nature of this project (Cheadle developed it for years), the notes just don't come together.",0
25354," Though Zodiac is structurally unwieldy and sags at times, as a whole it's still a procedural with kick...an atmospheric and mostly absorbing film.",1
310552," Letting things slide into a sort of low-calorie moral vacuum, Mackenzie hasn't so much nailed LA's culture of skin-deep gratification as produced an advert for it.",0
215979, The film isn't shy about its feelings about technology - it's time to unplug. It laments a culture that medicates pain away and has its head in virtual realms.,1
962,"On paper, Don't Let Go's premise - a supernaturally flecked crime story with a hint of time travel - should be exciting but it is let down down by workaday writing and routine filmmaking.",0
420488," Solo isn't a disaster, it's just an uninspired showing that is passably entertaining.",0
32952,You can almost hear the gears of Blake's moral mechanism churning as character's spit out their maxims.,0
9015,"It is sincere, well-meaning and, I'm sorry to say, quite transparent hokum.",0
44382,[Caine and Duvall] lift this button-pushing blob of faux folksiness to a higher plane than it deserves.,0
1762,"'Gebo' is an elemental thudding back to earth, body and soul entombed inside a dimly lit abode.",1
4497,Beats is an entertaining watch that is most effective in sharing its message about how poisonous fear can be - but it's also scattered in the execution of its vision.,1
591,"If there is a meaningful difference between performing and acting, Joaquin Phoenix surely exemplifies the former here, creepily contorting as the Clown Prince of Crime in Todd Phillips' timely, toxic take on the Making of a Murdering Madman.",1
14674,"Hoffman immerses himself in the character the way he usually did, giving Gunther Bachmann a tragic streak of frustration and righteousness",1
4675,"It may move at a glacial pace, and its presentation may not be anything new, but Wonders of the Deep offers a chance to take a minute (or 80) and meditate upon our treatment of the oceans that harbors us.",0
2753,"...a tonally inconsistent, unsatisfying film that is neither funny nor insightful...",0
21692,"Wilson, Dillon and Hudson are likable stars, and there are moments when their characters make a convincing circle of friends. But the Russo brothers don't have the maturity to blend the two prongs of the story they've written.",0
2410,"Holy Chicken! has some ideas, and many of them are good, but it's driven by a director-star who constantly gets in his own way.",0
45054,"[Director] Greengrass proves himself equally adept at action, building on the edginess of Doug Liman's original with a feverish handheld camera and frenetic editing.",1
4940,[A] dry retelling of the artist's life with much of the passion kept at bay.,0
39608,The backstage shenanigans and tear-stained soap opera are all too predictable in Country Strong but the performances lend it conviction and the soundtrack has enough heart and soul to endear it to true country music fans.,1

8857,"The sporadic appearances by Ali hopelessly unbalance the proceedings, his fiercely outspoken interviews providing the only morsels of substance.",0
87215," Adventure fails to permeate the listlessness of this overlong, self-indulgent would-be thriller.",0
32588,"Good, but not great ... Romero has been surpassed by his imitators, who have learned to make zombie flicks with greater skill than the master himself.",1
12395,"Mars Needs Moms becomes a stunning achievement not only in the visual and action stakes but emotionally as well, with a heartbreaking clarity putting into perspective the love and sacrifices that good mothers make for their children.",1
290074, This is Korine's trick: he pulls the audience into the decadence of Spring Break before exposing its soulless underside.,1
52329,An uneven and fairly forgettable comedy that produces only sporadic laughter.,0
73667," Lee and Prowse clearly have filmmaking abilities, but Afflicted doesn't feel complete. It's more of a cinematic sharpening stone than a deeply considered merging of genre and style.",0
1939,Director Michael Goi turns this savage cruise that promised to be more interesting into a boring excursion. [Full Review in Spanish],0
4584,Another faith-based drama with almost all its edge rubbed off -- no more unpleasant than it is challenging.,0

3872,Sword of Trust is funny. Laugh out loud so.,1
38698,"When you watch the film, you'll understand immediately why people are obsessed with its story. Fincher's movie, far truer to the novel than the Swedish version, will be a treat for fans of Larsson's series.",1
221658," Like an updating of 'Catcher in the Rye,' Steers' film shows how circumstances can make the possession of money almost irrelevant to some family members.",1
63111," There are a few amusing touches, but overall, Mortdecai sinks to the depths, its potential battered by an overdose of ham and a mannered performance by Johnny Depp that just doesn't fire",0
409,"From his time in the wilderness, Almodóvar has emerged with a stunner. Heavily introspective, Pain and Glory is about aging and finding a reason to go on when your body fails and inspiration is lacking.",1
4023,"... manages some moments of emotional honesty about starting over, although it sidesteps the creepy nature of Phil's scheme, preferring to pass off his actions as quirky charm.",0
131103, I don't care if the flick cost $14.54 to produce; it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.,1
2840,"For a film so desperate to be Zodiac, everyone would have seen this one coming.",0

40438,"Watch it, and laugh at the truth about love.",1
4087,"The film takes some familiar genre elements and mixes them up a little, delivering something that feels fresh, occasionally subversive yet -- at times -- as moving as it is outrageous. It's a comedy with plenty of smarts.",0
32912,"Jagged, unrelenting, claustrophobically intimate.",1
337123," Though the film has no lack of technical skill, what's missing is the spark of imagination",0
56958," Attractively shot but dramatically inert, this isn't persuasive enough to qualify as a tearjerker, and neither does it work as a substantive comedy.",0
117965," Jolie has a knack for picking out small details, but as a director she is captivated more by the story's elemental sweep than its human components. ",0
1071,"There's a visceral excitement to some of the gritty action sequences, although the screenplay suffers from derivative dialogue and strains credibility at every turn.",0

185352," The stand-up routines - from Jackie and the pros alike - are funny and blue enough to shock a few laughs out of you, sometimes in spite of your better judgment, and the star seems once again genuinely invested in creating a character.",1
1552,"Octavia Spencer, Naomi Watts and Tim Roth help deliver an intriguing, intelligent and realistically unresolved drama.",1
141632," It's meant to be thrilling fun, but it never takes off in the way imagined. There's no merriment in the .357-caliber chaos, no mirth in the staccato of bullets.",0
2731,You can never unsee dance sequences directed by Guy Ritchie.,0
5202,"As far as action cinema goes, Avengement is an absolute success, and I eagerly await to see what else Johnson has in store for us.",1
41387,"A remarkable, thoughtful comedy with memorable characters and striking action sequences.",1
48134," Mendonça's film, aided immeasurably by Braga's performance, confirms his status as a perceptive chronicler of modern experience.",1
2032,"Brad Anderson can direct films like Fractured - his latest, out on Netflix - in his sleep. So as a fan of his work, it came as a bit of a letdown that the filmmaker appeared to have done just that.",1
28295,"'Middle Men' may not have the action and slapstick comedy that one expects to see this late in the summer, but the film is filled with zest and actually worth exploring.",1
3952,"Utilizing every moment of the 97-minute runtime, Harvey offers something more than tricked-out gun fights, indestructible characters, and exposition-heavy dialogue.",0
112041," Wonderful; so funny and strange and human. An amazing portrait of a fascinating character, beautifully told with enormous suspense and tenderness.",1
209375," Is it insensitive? Jaw-droppingly so. But it's also tremendously funny, and after years of achingly serious movies about the War on Terror, it can't help but feel cathartic to unleash a few belly laughs at the whole mess.",1
85907," ""Derailed"" is a great film, that benefits the most from its direction, script, and acting, while the ending scene will probably haunt its audience for quite some time. Kim Ki-duk seems to have left quite a legacy in the country. ",1
5093,"With Neeson's recent confessions on the Cold Pursuit promotional tour, it's likely his latest foray in the genre may wind up being his last.",1
2081,The film moves along with an excellent narrative pulse. [Full Review in Spanish],1
3947,"Rather a slog...musters a grubby atmosphere but is otherwise a completely routine revenge tale, not unlike many that have come before.",0
172882, In its comedy of errors are actors who bring truth at least to their dialogue.,1

49817," ... Hardwicke recognizes that it is a story about people, not skateboards.",1
48611,Cohen really blood sucked his idea on this one,0
126876, What raises it above the level of conventional children's pulp entertainment is Yuen's dazzlingly choreographed acrobatic high-wire work.,1
97753," This might sound like a sentimental recipe, but Richard Curtis, who wrote and directed, keeps the spirit fresh and anarchic.",1
2747,"The proceedings are still intermittently fun, especially because of Jackson who is clearly in his element here.",1
14347,"Roll Bounce features taut skate choreography, but its storytelling isn't nearly so coordinated.",0
36938,"It's not half bad, largely because it places an absolute premium on brash, bawdy humor.",1
42630,"It loosens the shackles of a post-Pixar/post-Blue Sky animation landscape, where family entertainment must either be an emotional roller coaster or mindless slapstick.",1

17204,Hollow and pointless - a better title would have been 'Incoherent Vice.',0
423128," It teeters on the edge of camp pretension before whipping out its raison d'etre and being unapologetically political. That said, the sheer amount of bodily fluids displayed before it forecloses means it slightly outstays its welcome.",0
297,It works right up until someone very familiar appears and it's not Sarah. [Full review in Spanish].,0
275352," Instead of melting into the holes of the story like so much warm butter, the audience gets scraped across Anderson's room-temperature toast. There's no chemical reaction, which has the effect of leaving the audience cold.",1
5809,"The Dark Red isn't afraid to get a little bloody, and it's all the more entertaining for it.",1
67957," It's a grand adventure that delivers on its tale of survival and revenge, and though it might be a little too intense for some, it's ultimately well-worth the two and a half hours to experience one of the most breathtaking films of the year.",1
5362,"There's an existential quality to Arctic, a tremendously moving meditation on how we persevere through near-insurmountable hardships, what it takes to keep the light from going out.",1
5469,"An average documentary that will inspire, anger, and perhaps even motivate viewers to change the world.",0
3995,Shazam! is a great second act in the new Worlds of DC. It is a fun family superhero movie that never tries too hard to be what it wants to be.,1
