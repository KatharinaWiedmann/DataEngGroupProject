1428,The Shed,"RIP sparkly moody vampires, as The Shed takes them back to the monstrous beings they have always meant to be.",fresh
1429,The Shed,It operates on familiar tropes ... and then it twists it in very dark directions. It's just unfortunate it ultimately devolves into a stereotypical battle with an ancient evil.,fresh

5121,ANIARA,"ANIARA does not offer a resolution, nor hope, nor catharsis. The film presents, if anything, a warning: our existence is a universal privilege to cherish, not a selfish entitlement to be hubristically guarded.",rotten
5122,ANIARA,Aniara mostly feels like a dramatization of facts rather than telling a story.,fresh
5123,ANIARA,"Although little of this is new, it's delivered with poise and grace, aided by finely tuned performances. Interpersonal dynamics are explored with a light touch but it takes only the slightest deviation to reveal great gulfs of darkness.",fresh
5124,ANIARA,"It's an acquired taste and its view on humanity is perhaps blacker than the depths of space, but Aniara is sci-fi of melancholy near-brilliance.",rotten
5125,ANIARA,"You start going through all the logistical problems inherent in this scenario... [But] once I was able to get past some of that, then I was able to absorb some of the big existential questions.",fresh
5126,ANIARA,"Aniara cogently makes the point that if mankind ever does manage to leave this blighted planet for another, we'll bring our problems with us.",rotten

5128,ANIARA,"A haunting allegorical tale, Aniara warns of humanity hurtling in the wrong direction and realising too late that there is no turning back.",fresh
5129,ANIARA,Pella Kagerman and Hugo Lilja's adaptation of a 2018 sci-fi poem finds bleak beauty in a nihilisitic odyssey.,fresh
5130,ANIARA,"Special effects are used minimally, the directors instead concentrating on the fragile human emotions of the disparate travellers, among whom Jonsson especially impresses.",fresh
5131,ANIARA,A strange and unsettling sci-fi which has a rather bleak outlook on the future of humanity.,fresh
5132,ANIARA,"It's terrifying precisely because it looks current rather than space age. We see ourselves reflected more clearly, and don't have the luxury of thinking that a futuristic setting means we have time to spare. Oh and the ending is a belter.",fresh
5133,Ladies in Black,"Ladies in Black fits the bill, beautifully.",fresh
5134,Ladies in Black,"I love this film. I absolutely, unabashedly love it... It's a wonderful, pastoral, poetic, melodramatic and oftentimes very funny and touching portrait of 1959 Sydney.",fresh

5142,Ladies in Black,"As a light, lovely-looking entertainment, Ladies in Black is a superlative chick flick that celebrates femininity and independence as mutually supportive qualities...the film also champions how Australia was built by a rich mix of cultures.",fresh
5143,Ladies in Black,The way every ruffle of a dress or lace embellishment is offered a moment and how audiences can admire the pattern of a gown as much as the acting recalls Jocelyn Moorhouse's The Dressmaker...,fresh
5144,Ladies in Black,"From the eye-popping colours of the period's fabulous floral dresses to the snapped suspenders and silk petticoats beneath, this is a film above all for women who love fashion.",fresh

5153,Starfish,"A fantasy story without much plot, of how one person survives loss and the apocalypse.",fresh
5154,Starfish,"There's a lot to like about Starfish, but the choppy editing, the overly arthouse way it presents some of the themes, and underdeveloped aspects of the story in favor of the aural experience is ostracizing.",fresh
5155,Starfish,"Peppered with mind-bending images, White's visually impressive feature debut takes cues from genre flicks like The Signal, Pontypool, The Endless and Cloverfield, as well as producing jolting shocks and a manga-style animated interlude.",fresh
5156,Starfish,"A. T. White's fascinating debut feature isn't exactly hard science fiction, but there's certainly a logic to it. ""Starfish"" is one strange retro ride.",fresh

5161,The Perfection,"The Perfection takes deep, fetishistic satisfaction in pushing the envelope, then pushing it some more, building in seductive fits and shocking starts to an orgiastic frenzy of cinematic excess.",fresh
5162,The Perfection,"The film's indefinability is admirable while also frustrating, the plot leaping around in a rather graceless fashion, spinning back, forth and sideways with ambition but not always success.",rotten
5163,The Perfection,"It is complexly, an emotionally draining, exhilirating, and liberating quest.",fresh
5164,The Perfection,"The fact that most of it works pretty well is a happy, bloody, and creepy surprise.",rotten
5165,The Perfection,It's difficult to know when bungled takes are compensated by good enough film-making that the end result is acceptable...,fresh
5166,The Perfection,"In its final form, this one-of-a-kind genre Frankenstein is a stand-out terror in an increasingly inventive and competitive field. Controversial, slippery, and sickening, The Perfection will get you screaming, then talking.",fresh
5167,The Perfection,"For those who like their films a little darker than mainstream studios are willing to bankroll, The Perfection might be right for you. It's dirty, messy moviemaking with a message.",fresh
5168,The Perfection,"As the twists and turns get even more egregious, The Perfection just becomes a chore to watch. It's unfortunate because the final beat is actually chilling and portends what could have been. A lighter touch would have been welcome.",fresh
