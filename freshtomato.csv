22,1, The story is incredible.
24,1," It's virtually all Hemsworth's show and he's entirely up to the task of carrying the film on his broad shoulders: He's charismatic, fearless, confident, jokey and a good old Kentucky boy who just wants to get the job done ..."
25,1," An exhaustive, ruminative, angry and even occasionally gallows-humorous account of the strange domino effect of tragedy compounding incompetence compounding tragedy that dealt a critical blow to one of America's great cities."
30,1," An intense mix of horror, thriller and domestic drama, this is exquisite filmmaking."

79,1," A fascinating and intoxicating tale of cannibalism that examines the savage sexual awakening of a shy adolescent, whose complex psychology and inner struggle are described with great delicacy. [Full Review in Spanish]"

102,1," It's clear that this portrait of a sick society is meant to explain, at least partially, the horrendous war that breaks out at the very end of the film, and the fascism that quickly followed in its wake."
104,1,"Confident, uncompromising and blisteringly realistic, Sweet Sixteen is a gritty and immediate film yet it goes right to the emotions."
105,1," Torres's...writing is blunt and evocative, like poetry turned prose. The new film adaptation of the book by director Jeremiah Zagar turns the story back into poetry again."
106,1," Storytelling in its purest form: it works as a no-fat thriller, yet it achieves nuanced character dimension and thematic complexity"
108,1," People cynically walk into so much expecting disappointment - auditoriums showing Woody Allen's annual crapshoot, for example. Sometimes, they get expected middling results. Sometimes, as with Allen's 30-year-old script, they get unanticipated surprises."

153,1," I was afraid this was going to be another case where a greedy studio doing a book adaptation managed to screw things up by splitting a book in half, ending up with a movie with half a story, but this one works out O.K."
156,1," The film gets long in the tooth and it's ambition to be both dirty and touching spreads a solid story a little thin...but ""Trainwreck"" has so much in it to like, not the least of which is the future potential of more Amy Schumer/Judd Apatow collaborations."
158,1," It's rare for a film about a Mexican drug cartel and the impossibility of the American Dream to be either disarming or funny, but Clint Eastwood has blessedly delivered one that is consistently both."
159,1, It's an example of a clever actress taking control of her career.
160,1, The film delivers laughs and heart and some strong ideas and energy...
161,1," An attractive and robust screen adaptation of the classic 1861 Dickens parable of false hopes, thwarted vanities and the mysterious workings of sowing and reaping."

176,1," The film never stops moving, and it's always a pleasure to watch."
177,1,"The ultimate destination creates the opportunity for Penn to draw up a summation for his protagonist's journey, and it's a moral that should satisfy those viewers looking for meaning and order."
178,1," Before taking a dark swerve into chilling verité at the close, BlacKkKlansman ... kicks up suggestions of the pilot for a great 1970s mismatched cop show. It's that funky."
181,1," The film teases us with a paradox: arguably Nim's keepers were wrong to try to endow their protege with human attributes, but can we empathise with his suffering without making the same mistake?"
183,1," If you watched all of the ""Mission: Impossible"" films in a row, starting with 1996's original, would they feel like a James Bond version of ""Boyhood""? Maybe."
184,1," Jordan Peele has made something scathing, hilarious, and -- as unlikely as this may sound -- totally fresh. I am pleased -- who am I kidding? I'm f----g thrilled -- to announce that Get Out is a legitimately great movie."

197,1," At its best, Tropic Thunder skewers impotent directors, fascist producers, prima donna stars and classic scenes from the camo-fatigues genre."
198,1," A meticulously shot and sharply written character study, it plays like a blend of the Coen brothers and Quentin Tarantino."
199,1," The acting is very convincing by Hoss and Zehrfeld. Writer-Director Christian Petzold (""Barbara"") has crafted a compelling ghost story about a woman, thought to be dead, who gets a chance to see what people really thought about her."
203,1," Exciting, provocative genre cinema."
204,1," The humor is spot on, and the film drew some genuine laughs from me, especially the scene with Richie and the cricket bat."
205,1," The sins of fathers, sons and lovers come pouring onto the audience in a torrent of stifling intensity."

228,1," Fincher's strange romantic epic has its greatest impact the first time around. Overall, the film seems more like a beautiful curio than anything else, a sort of artsy fartsy Forest Gump."
229,1," It's exciting, foreboding, grand and important, a part of our culture and identity no matter how loudly cineastes scream bloody murder."
231,1, City of Men has the electrically oversaturated style of reality that made City of God such a searing vision of teenage criminal life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro.

234,1, Slick and playful entertainment that remains carefully inoffensive beneath its veneer of bad manners.

238,1, It's impossible to tell the experienced from the inexperienced among Loach's casts.

242,1," The film definitely has its moments, and at arm's length, The Promise will resonate. But overall, it feels like a missed opportunity, a good film that could have been much better."
243,1," The film builds steadily, but never tediously, to the long awaited mission to Abbottabad and the compound housing Osama bin Laden."

261,1, A beautiful and shamelessly honest film about the fragility of life. [Full review in Spanish]
265,1," This 1930s-set drama chronicling events leading to the deportation of a little-known, real-life Irish political activist is a graceful digest of Loach's signature motifs."
270,1," An examination of whether vigilante justice - no matter how well-intentioned at the start - is doomed, ultimately, to become just another example of would-be good guys falling prey to the lure of egotism and/or big money."
271,1," An authentic depiction of depression, mental illness, and a poetic meditation on mankind's relationship with the universe."
273,1," The same effortless chemistry that made the comedians such ideal Golden Globes hosts is on full display in this broad comedy, given extra oomph by a wise and glorious R rating that opens the floodgates of creative vulgarity."

281,1," This incarnation of Fanny may not have been what Austen had in mind, but she surely would have approved, for the injection of attitude and smarts makes Mansfield Park a much more wicked and irresistible social satire..."
283,1," [Director Dome] Karukoski guides us on a journey of reflection, where distance is not so much geographic, but emotional. [Full review in Spanish]"
285,1, [Oliver] Stone uses a lot of visual effects to give some energy to a very conventional story...
286,1," There's nothing like seeing Fela himself - blowing his sax, expressing his unbridled sexuality and living a life like no other."
290,1, A rather watchable film that is reminiscent of The Bodyguard (sans the stalker sub-plot) that also works well as warm-hearted romance with soap opera elements.
295,1,"What Black's movie really has going for it is pace. It starts with a crash, followed swiftly by a bang and vast swathes of wallop. The relentlessness doesn't allow you any time to catch a yawn, but it's also not too conducive to tension or suspense."
296,1," Real-life love stories rarely work out quite so faultlessly, but for two hours it's nice to believe that they could."

303,1,"The Mambo Kings"" is so pumped up with life it threatens to burst. It's beautifully filmed and flashily edited. It pulsates with rhythmic ecstasy. It throbs, it sweats, it pounds, it undulates."

305,1," It's not the deepest movie of the season, but it has sprightly performances and cinematic style to spare."

312,1," As it stands, it's an efficient, diverting new entry in Neeson's ongoing action canon, albeit one which suggests his He-Man career route has finally reached the end of the line."
315,1, Tim Burton magic with just a touch of scariness.
316,1,"If the thought of another Australian film with a soundtrack full of ABBA songs scares you away from this film, buck up and see it anyway."
318,1, A horror-fantasy that all involved should be wholeheartedly proud to be a part of.

329,1, Stephen King's The Mist is a reminder of what a great horror movie is all about.
333,1," 3/4 is a small but ambitious drama with a perfectly symmetrical structure, using minimal means, nonprofessional actors, and everyday conversations to convey its characters' innermost feelings. "
335,1," Aaron Johnson may not be Lennon, but he?s entirely persuasive as someone who could have grown up to become him. It?s a striking pre-incarnation. "
336,1," Once you've been away from 'The Fall' for 24 hours or so, you reflect on its sheer beauty."
337,1, [F]eatures one of the most engaging ensemble casts I've seen in a goodly while... So hurrah for this band of gal pals at various romantic crossroads...

352,1," DeBlois, who also wrote the script, successfully juggles the multiple story lines, shifting allegiances and uncharted lands."
355,1, Tedeschi combines the raw sensuality of an Anna Magnani with the melancholic introspection of a Monica Vitti and is well worth discovering.

359,1," Funny, feel-good movie has excellent messages for kids."

379,1," Director Mimi Leder admirably insisted on making the human relationships count for as much as the cheap thrills in this killer- comet movie. But the cheap thrills -- expensive thrills, actually -- are mostly what make Deep Impact fun to watch."
382,1, A story that deftly sneaks up on you before grabbing your emotions by the throat. 
383,1,"Exhilarating, visually astounding, thought-provoking and very, very funny."

408,1,"There's a self-aware feel to the period pageantry, the alternatingly seductive and kinetic cinematography, and the actor's showcase this ramshackle contraption has been held together with spit and bailing wire to be."
409,1," To her credit, Ms. Reichardt never allows her camera to become a voyeuristic witness to a young woman in distress. Instead, it remains focused on a largely indifferent American landscape of strangers in perpetual motion to nowhere."
411,1,"L'Auberge Espagnole"" isn't a perfect, or at times very even, film, but it's chock-full of a kind of experimentation and fun rarely found in the slick, polished and ready for the masses fare that the studios usually traffic in"
412,1," If you can stay awake, you'll be struck by the nuanced performances, the depth of the characterisation, the intensity of the moral questions and the drips of black humour."
413,1," [Achieves] level of visceral intensity that rivals the jacked-up, heart-in-mouth tension that was previously the preserve of the best fiction film-makers."
416,1," This ""Dawn of the Dead"" inspired chiller is strong on concept, style and brutally violent action, but suffers from poor musical scoring, and a digital video format that helped keep its budget at 10 million dollars."
418,1, A style and tone as impressive as its action.
419,1, A film with a developed staging and that creates an interesting dialectic between reality and fiction through images. [Full review in Spanish]
420,1,"It doesn't want to explore epistemological questions about the nature of perception and memory; it just wants to mess with our heads. And as a wily, slightly sadistic chess game of a movie, it succeeds quite nicely."
421,1," Like the best ad man, he makes his point by making us laugh."
422,1, The stealthiest comedy since American Psycho.
423,1," A challenging but worth-it experience for more reasons than one can actually speak (or write) in words. It's a documentary to be watched over time, with a Carthusian level of contemplation."
424,1," Just because the characters are crazy, that doesn't mean they are not smart."
425,1, belies its low budget with both an impressive cast headed by veteran character actors and director Bob Clark's creative economy
427,1, This is one of the screen's most rewarding explorations of the teacher/student relationship in any language. Every voice we hear makes sense; every opinion means something.
429,1," Goes solely for today's oversaturation of superheroes and jabs it for all its worth. In-jokes, Easter eggs, and background details abound throughout. I highly enjoyed this film. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, etc. - also Available)"
430,1," Radcliffe's first post-Potter outing is plenty atmospheric, in the style of Roger Corman's Poe series. It's just not all that scary ‒ unless you find rattling doorknobs and dead children's faces pressed to frosty windows scary."
432,1," Adult horror returns to the screen with the crisp and frightening The Orphanage, a haunted-house tale about the dueling forces of childhood friendship and maternal love."
434,1, [T]here's... an oddly poignant attempt to redeem a hackneyed genre from pointless insensitivity.
435,1," Under The Sand lifts the phantom-spouse syndrome to the level of art, yet another dimension for this popular form."
437,1," Aside from the silly title and disappointingly pat ending, even the rom-com-averse will find something to love about Man Up."
439,1," If I myself find anything worth worshipping, it's the creative genius of people like M. Night Shyamalan, at whose feet I am not worthy to grovel."
442,1," The film is meant to be a negotiation of what that long-ago relationship was, and it is that. But in our reality of pervasive sexual iniquity, it also feels an awful lot like a litany of self-serving excuses for pedophilic behavior."
444,1,"It is entertaining and often very funny, even when you hope that director Harron will next find a subject that is truly worthy of her considerable talents."
446,1," Hysterically potent, thought-provoking and deliciously nostalgic. Overall, the proposed chatter is warranted in the movingly impish Talk to Me."
448,1,"Channeling spaghetti westerns, Cervantes, Castaneda, and a dash of CHINATOWN as refracted through the visual sensibilities of Dali, it is a fiendishly clever concretion of high- and low-brow in a story that is both vision quest and farce"
453,1,"Personally, it's my favorite out of the four Vacation films. Many people don't agree with me, however."
454,1," Great acting, sharp visuals, but edited in such a confusing way that a second viewing might be needed."
460,1," In Loach's hands, it has a measure of dignity and it works beautifully."
461,1," ... it isn't trying to be a blockbuster, and yet it out-blockbusters almost everything else this summer... "
463,1," It's not Lee's most challenging work, but it's certainly amongst his most charming."
464,1," ""The Great Gatsby"" not so great, but pays a decent tribute to the novel."
465,1," Despite the predictable body-shifting premise and a heavy dose of sentimentality, this teen comedy is extremely enjoyable"
466,1, Depp terrifies as dangerously violent real-life gangster.
468,1, This is a very accomplished movie.
471,1, Bigelow crowns several decades of excellent artistic enquiry with a film that everybody should see.
474,1," If it can get someone who's so out of its core demographic a little verklempt, imagine what it can do for someone who's a target for such fare."
475,1, X-Men earns another shot at being a seminal comic-book franchise.
476,1," The Eyes of My Mother is effective and unsettling, and as a first movie from Pesce, promises much more in the future."
477,1," In one of his last films films to be released, the late Philip Seymore Hoffman gives another of his pitch-perfect performances in this twisted spy yarn set in Hamburg, Germany."
479,1," ""Aquarius"" is a marvelous and surprising act of portraiture, a long, unhurried encounter with a single, complicated person."
480,1," quirky, off-beat and all around charming... has a lot of heart."
481,1," Genius nudges its nose, or maybe just the brim of its fedora, ahead of a lot of prestige biopics."
484,1, Intense and delicately nuanced.
487,1," Warm, darkly humorous, bittersweet and tender. Rolf Lassgård is a revelation. "
490,1," That doesn't dampen the work of Richardson and Sprouse, or the romance at the film's center. ""Five Feet Apart"" works hard for its tears. But it's the honesty of the performances that makes it worth the investment."
