~Unnamed: 0~Review~Freshness
0~1~A cornball drone of greeting-card sentiment.~0
1~3~I don't like important movies anyway. Once you set out to be important, I don't buy it.~0
2~4~ The Void marks a new, more serious direction for Canadian genre filmmaking collective Astron-6.~1
3~5~The only way to look at Couples Retreat as a bookend to Swingers is to note how far these two talented stars have fallen.~0
4~9~ a tame and insultingly derivative version of POLTERGEIST. ~0
5~10~How sorry can you feel for rich, unadventurous Americans in a major funk?~0
6~11~"Though not particularly groundbreaking or memorable, ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" definitely exceeds the standards for a modern family film and it's almost guaranteed to entertain any kid who goes to see it."~1
7~16~"""Blood"" [chapter three] is conversely magnificent enough to render the whole worth checking out alone."~1
8~19~The lack of empathetic characters seems more a filmmaking deficiency than some grand cinematic plan. The viewer definitely leaves the movie feeling unsatisfied.~0
9~21~This modern fantasy weds the techniques of silent cinema with CGI to conjure a memorably mythic realm.~1
10~22~The best film I've ever seen with a full grown man masquerading as a baby...hmmm.~0
11~27~ After being surprised by Fifty Shades Of Grey, you can now colour me disappointed with Fifty Shades Darker.~0
12~34~An inert thriller.~0
13~35~What cannot be argued is that Phoenix has once again turned in an Oscar-worthy performance...~1
14~36~Amid the glut of teen dreck that usually insults our intelligence, Donnie Darko shines.~1
15~38~It is ultimately just a reproduction of brand in an attempt to make a billion dollars. On that level, and only that level, The Lion King is a success.~0
16~40~I laughed frequently, but the problem is that I'm not sure the director intended there to be as much humor in his film as I uncovered.~0
17~42~Fighting with My Family's trump card is an emotional one, and it's well played.~1
18~46~Weinstein walks a tightrope similar to the one of his main character, and though Menashe may occasionally falter, this director impressively does not in his first feature.~1
19~47~[A] frenetic jumble of subplots and sleazy characters...~0
20~50~Joe Manganiello gets a nice showcase here, believably portraying a once can't miss baseball prospect.~1
21~55~Inherit The Viper had the potential to be an exciting thriller with dramatic family elements. Instead, its characters fall flat as if the actors were not allowed or unwilling to flesh out their characters more.~0
22~60~Without the newness of the first film to give it some electricity, this Harry Potter outing comes off as harmless but flat.~1
23~62~Anna is worth watching and if you are a Besson fan, you won't be disappointed.~1
24~64~Although I am grateful for the conversations on Black joy and love that this film has sparked, it flattens the experience of being Black in a time of heightened white supremacy, and in the end leads us nowhere.~0
25~66~A lovely tale of reinvention from the writer of A Man Called Ove, featuring Swedish acting royalty Pernilla August.~1
26~68~A funny movie. Ha-ha funny sometimes, but more frequently amusing in a good-natured, make-you-smile way.~1
27~74~While [All the Bright Places] remains sensitive towards its heavy themes of mental-illness and suicide, it also ends up being a little problematic in it's road to closure.~0
28~75~ Lean, almost absurdly satisfying.~1
29~77~Though indulgently violent and rather broad at all times, it's consistently exciting due to the premise and the charismatic star turn,~1
30~79~Aside from a few inspired vistas and alien life-forms, John Carter is as deadly dull as its basso-voiced, beefcake slab of a star.~0
31~82~A major Marvel/Avengers star turns up in the scenes set at Chronic-Con, although it's the end-credits cameo that might lead to eyes tearing up (nuff said).~1
32~89~It all makes for an intriguing setup as we analyze each character and their personal versions of the truth.~1
33~90~Euphoria would have done better to confront and embrace the challenge of an agnostic argument for euthanasia, and there is certainly one to make. Instead, the movie presents its talking points like a checklist.~1
34~92~"""The Death and Life of John F. Donovan"" is a potentially powerful story, though one not successfully told in the slightest by Xavier Dolan."~0
35~94~Gruesome gore is the sole highlight.~0
36~95~ The most disappointing film of the year: not dreadful, but falling so far from the brilliant initial film that its good points hardly matter. ~0
37~98~Julia's late career seems an apologia for buying someone else's husband and getting away with it, for the most part, in the court of public opinion.~0
38~103~Surprisingly free of painful barbs.~0
39~106~Into the Wild didn't make me want to eke out a living in an abandoned bus, but it did make me yearn - just a little bit - for my younger, less cynical days~1
40~110~The inexperienced cast is earnest but wooden, easily upstaged by the stark beauty of the Ghanaian countryside where the movie was filmed.~0
41~112~ While beautiful, both the film and its female lead are cold and distant.~0
42~114~ Higgins' skilled, intrusive, yet tenderly watchful eye blends with the performances and punchy, unexpected shifts in tone and direction that come from Fischer's more experienced writing style.~1
43~116~Decent action sequences can't bring much meaning to this tepid, miscast melodrama.~0
44~117~Clumsy, innocent, awkward, to be sure, but it's never skimpy on the fun.~1
45~119~"Mutant powers, a post-apocalyptic setting, a main character whose coming of age coincides with her becoming a hero: ""The Darkest Minds"" recycles many popular cinematic tropes, resulting in a familiar young-adult drama that struggles to find its voice."~0
46~122~This creature feature has the right amount of gore, and just enough plot to bring it all together. The monster will not disappoint.~1
47~125~The most compelling message of this unflinching, powerful, and haunting movie is that in Jesus' name we are obligated to extend our compassion to victims everywhere.~1
48~126~ After stumbling out of the huddle and getting flagged for a few false start penalties, Friday Night Lights finally gets the chains moving in the second half.~1
49~127~Between Two Ferns: The Movie will most likely land on the slightly divisive with audiences parameter, but it looks increasingly clear that the performance of Galifianakis will appease most.~1
50~129~Well-acted, original sci-fi indie is short and sweet.~1
51~130~Its inspiring message of elderly empowerment would have been more persuasive if Edie's adventure was more grounded in reality.~0
52~131~Leilo's empathy for his characters is matched by his actors' skills.~0
53~133~Terry Gilliam's third fantasy feature may not achieve all it reaches for, but it goes beyond Time Bandits and Brazil in its play with space and time.~1
54~137~They easily could have turned this setup into a thriller, but instead, they've made a quiet, thoughtful film...~1
55~138~The lack of clarity distracts from whatever the story is with these girls.~0
56~140~It's a personal and profound work.~1
57~143~A Final Destination movie with the air of respectability that Clint Eastwood commands, but absolutely no fun. Clint Eastwood doing Final Destination may sound awesome, but this is a movie just designed to make you feel miserable. ~0
58~146~Three Christs is a film that sits between being good and being bad. It's good in its choice of actors and fascinating exploration of the human mind, but it's bad because it's a slog and the female characters feel like objects.~0
59~153~ Craig makes an amiable anti-hero with vague echoes of Steve McQueen. He's a guy we root for, even though we know he won't be able to cut that layer cake without spilling crumbs.~1
60~154~The film finds a credible way to tell the story of a global conquest. [Full Review in Spanish]~1
61~160~ ...a consistently underwhelming horror endeavor that seems to exist for no reason other than to serve the current 3D fad...~0
62~161~An almost irrationally infectious retelling of the Orpheus-Eurydice chestnut set during carnival and feverish with hip-swiveling hustle, exploding local color, and sleeve-worn heart.~1
63~165~A heartwarming saga of the relationship of an elderly woman with a man fifty years her junior amid the spartan splendor of the Scottish highlands.~1
64~172~ Stay home and watch any of Ferrell's past films, all of which are more worthwhile than this monotonously unfunny tripe.~0
65~180~One of the many problems, other than Damon's lack of emotion, is the fact that there's no suspense.~0
66~186~It's not worth the quality time you could be spending with your children or the extra change in your wallet.~0
67~189~It's a deserving subject that should be explored in a more viable film, but Identity Thief is so bad it's hard to believe it wasn't directed by Judd Apatow or the Farrelly Brothers.~0
68~190~ This clunky, claustrophobic, Aussie-made dystopian thriller has a plot that seems to have been constructed out of odds and ends from Ridley Scott and Christopher Nolan sci-fi movies.~0
69~193~Fans of the series will consider this a must-see... For people not dying to know his origins, though, Hannibal Rising is, at best, a mildly diverting thriller...~0
70~197~The White Crow offers up all these elements of Nureyev - his past, his heat, his vulnerabilities - but all those parts are dancing around each other incongruously rather than as a well-choreographed ensemble piece.~1
71~200~There is a special place in the satire hall of fame for any movie that can prompt public rebukes from both Matt Drudge and Sean Penn.~1
72~201~ It bogs down quickly, but with enough eye-popping details, and a career-making turn by Cooper, to make it seem like it's going somewhere~0
73~202~[Adopt a Highway] demonstrates an acute awareness of emotional honesty.~1
74~204~Bleed For This is twelve rounds of tedium, a boring boxing movie that draws most of its strength from memories of other, better experiences.~0
75~206~ Mixing POLTERGEIST with Disney's Haunted Mansion ride, a staggeringly disappointing and silly second half mars INSIDIOUS' strong, scary first half.~1
76~216~ Long, unfocused film.~0
77~217~The ill-advised mansion purchase is just the first in an endless series of blunders in this half-baked thriller.~0
78~223~ Fantastic Four feels like a 100-minute trailer for a movie that never happens.~0
79~224~A possible cult hit, it's too self-indulgent to find a mass audience.~0
80~225~"Every shot of Paradise Hills is otherworldly in its beauty. I'm not sure how it ""reads"" as a narrative, but as a visual work of art, a tone poem, and a riff on some familiar but evergreen themes it makes one stand and applaud."~1
81~228~ Darren Aronofsky has made one of those rare movies that gets right in your face and demands a response: Love me, hate me, just don't mess with Mister In-Between.~1
82~232~ Many Wes Anderson films have been intricately laced together, the ingredients blending just so. But nothing matches this perfectly layered concoction, wrapped up in an impeccable confectioner's bow.~1
83~234~ It's unlikely that Miss Congeniality will stem the backwards slide of Bullock's career momentum.~0
84~235~The scenery is gorgeous; one would wish the screenplay and its execution measured up to the scenery.~0
85~241~While perhaps overdependent on coincidence and contrivance, this deft thriller guards its secret right to the end and proved a fitting swan song to Fritz Lang's Hollywood career.~1
86~242~ By turns absorbing, unsettling and, for lack of a better word, icky.~0
87~245~...isn't all it could be but its heart is definitely in the right place.~1
88~248~ Emily Blunt is remarkable, her sleepy eyes (true to photographs of Queen Victoria) compensated by a vibrant physicality and the sense that something's going on behind her gaze, a rare and valuable quality in actors.~1
89~249~ An engaging and exciting tale and a magnificent achievement of visual storytelling that will likely be held up as a model for what can be achieved through the marriage of imagination and technology.~1
90~253~ This is a film that knows something about how hope, when it comes, is always a surprise.~1
91~255~A feel-good movie to the beat of The Boss' hits that draws from the basic recipe of the realist and well-intentioned British comedy. [Full Review in Spanish]~1
92~260~ While Team Glum & Glummer clearly deserve each other, their audience deserves much better.~0
93~262~"In ""Wild Rose,"" that heartbreak can - and does - become something beautiful."~1
94~264~A beautifully and sensitively told story~1
95~267~ Maverick may be as close as anything comes to a perfect summer movie (as opposed to a perfect movie).~1
96~268~It's wild and funny. Also disturbing. Also borderline insane. ~1
97~280~ Believable or subtle, Tulipani is not. But even with its narrative contortions, it is good-hearted and unembarrassed to wield ridiculousness (an explosive fart joke), clichés and anything else it can muster to win over an audience~1
98~284~When that joy works its way up to his face and Billy finally smiles, the theater lights up with him.~1
99~293~ A lot of fun. Just not quite as much fun as the original.~1
100~301~I've always been a fan of her music. With Linda Ronstadt - The Sound of My Voice, I am stricken anew.~1
101~302~There are still a lot of good movies slated for November and December, but it's hard to imagine anything topping the Coen brothers' chiller-thriller No Country for Old Men.~1
102~317~Beyond a delight in mood, there's no attempt to do anything with Annabelle that hasn't been done in the earlier films, and frequently quite a bit less.~0
103~319~The tragedy of what took place underwater is what resonates here, as well as the repugnant behavior of those who refused to help. [Full Review in Spanish]~1
104~320~We have seen this story in a hundred other movies ... But Eastwood, as the producer, director and star, caresses the material as if he didn't know B movies have gone out of style.~1
105~330~ Another slapstick dose of hard-R ridiculosity with a soft-nougat center, but it also passes the Bechdel test maybe better than any other film this year, and its older generation of stars are too smart not to go to town on their stock roles.~1
106~333~Shelton's strong, stinging film -- one of the year's best -- wants to get at something ingrained in the American character: the irrational desire to make saints of sports heroes.~1
107~335~Emanuel should be required viewing to consistently remind us that we should never become comfortable with mass shootings. That is not the America I grew up in and shouldn't be the America you want for your children. Thank you Viola, Steph and Mariska.~1
108~336~" If you do watch -- and you certainly should -- you will see one of the most remarkable performances ever set to film, given by Gabourey ""Gabby"" Sidibe."~1
109~337~[Roth] does bring the sensibility as far as atmosphere, as far as craft. He brings that darkness to it, but it doesn't become so dark that you can't get into it. ~1
110~345~ Suicide Squad isn't exactly the movie that audiences are hoping for, and not the bounce-back that the series needed after Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.~0
111~355~"Let's just call it ""Leonard &amp; Marianne,"" because it's just mostly about him."~0
112~356~This powerful tale of galling entitlement and ruthless insensitivity is filtered through an impressive performance by Clarke, who finds in Kennedy the pathological combination of a man stunned by what he has done, yet stirred by what he must do.~1
113~357~Acknowledges both the struggles of women and the fact that people of color have always been part of society, even during the Renaissance and Age of Discovery. ~1
114~359~"""Mapplethorpe"" paints a dark, depressing picture of the tortured artist but does little to answer any questions about his motivations."~0
115~362~ I'll give it this - Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is hilarious. Sadly, not intentionally so.~0
116~364~ Takes an exceedingly complicated story- the Wiki-Leaks saga- and boils it down into a compact two hour movie that's consistently entertaining and easy-to-follow.~1
117~369~ I found something a little verbose and stagey in this story in movie form.~0
118~372~While Lane is her typical winning self, the film is mawkish.~0
119~373~While it's hard to recommend it on purely creative merit, I suppose it would be a wonderful thing if these silly flies ended up pushing kids to investigate space travel and the legacy of NASA. Unlikely, but it's more comforting than fart and burp jokes.~0
120~375~Despite all this copycatting, the movie still has an interesting energy.~1
121~378~Hey, 'Standing Up' is nothing particularly profound, just a nice little keeper. Go out to find it and enjoy.~1
122~379~ The good news is, it's Steven Spielberg. The not-so-good news: The Spielberg sci-fi magic is missing in this adaptation of Ernest Cline's young-adult novel...all in all, Spielberg would do well to return to the real world.~0
123~384~ Right from the get-go, Looking For Grace throws tonal consistency out the window, bouncing from broad comedy to serious drama at will, and not always seamlessly.~0
124~388~Each shot is composed with care. [Full review in Spanish]~1
125~389~A snazzy-looking mixed bag. Kids will be diverted, adults will tolerate it, and all involved will be expecting something more imaginative than what Jerry Seinfeld has whittled together.~0
126~391~ Class differences and family resentments add to the hubbub surrounding an African-American wedding on Martha's Vineyard in this perceptive, faith-based romantic comedy.~1
127~392~ If you're nine years old you'll really be into it. If you're somewhat older you'll be wondering why they suddenly decided to remake Rent as a children's film.~0
128~395~ The ABCs Of Death 2 has something for the deviant in all of us, assembling another winning collection boasting sick, twisted, psychotic fun.~1
129~396~This existential tale about an afterworld exclusively for suicide victims and a handful of newcomers attempting to navigate the landscape pulsates originality through its uncanny way of incorporating the familiar into the offbeat.~1
130~397~...a dreamy movie that's all about the textures, the flat valley light glancing off the David Hockney planes. It's a movie that revels in its moviedom even as it replicates, in a very naturalistic way, a particular time and place.~1
131~399~The fluidity, the smoothness of the 3D animation...people, it looks good, incredible.~1
132~400~ Instead of luring us down an ever-darker and twistier path, it strands us in a tedious and ill-designed maze.~0
133~403~Disney's strongest CG animated effort to date can be credited to the strength of a premise that mixes what's worked so well in earlier Disney animated films with a better awareness of what makes a movie entertaining both for kids and adults.~1
134~404~An incredibly well-executed thriller that transcends its admittedly pulpy and occasionally ridiculous source material with an extraordinary degree of technical skil~1
135~412~ This tacky, simple and heartless affair doesn't quite live up to expectations.~0
136~417~ More compelling as an intellectual exercise than an emotional one.~1
137~418~The equivalent of cinematic easy listening.~1
138~419~ Such a nonstop go-for-broke sensibility can be too much of a good thing, of course, and there are moments when the filmmaker's mix-and-match methodology feels tuned to the key of migraine.~0
139~434~ So bogged down in problems that it's hard to enjoy what could have been a touching coming-of-age story. ~0
140~437~There's an audience for such lazy sentimentality, which means Crowe's half-hearted attempt to revive his career might actually succeed.~0
141~446~In the spirit of last year's Hero, House of Flying Daggers elevates the martial arts flick into the realm of high art.~1
142~448~Streep makes her character known in no time flat. Intelligence, humor, blocked ambition, self-irony -- they're all contained in Francesca's quick response when Robert asks if she has any plans for the afternoon.~1
143~452~The fact that most of it works pretty well is a happy, bloody, and creepy surprise.~0
144~455~The performances in the film are spot-on, especially Theron as Kelly.~1
145~459~Giant Little Ones is a step forward in the Canadian coming-of-age movie. It tackles teen sexual fluidity in a sensitive way, without taking place at a cottage in the summer.~1
146~466~ A holiday gift wrapped in sadness -- but tied tenderly with hope.~1
147~467~The romantic aspects also fail to move you, and as for the comedy, it is the supporting cast (Rauch and Lacy) who make you laugh.~0
148~469~ ...an often beguiling piece of computer animation that could nonetheless benefit from a gentler touch.~0
149~470~Gwen is [William McGregor's] debut film; an assured start, deeply unsettling and bleak ... [trading] in a dark, slow horror that creeps on you in waves [and] grounded in reality.~1
150~473~ A dreary tale of two loser brothers who agree to become assassins in exchange for financial help from their corrupt uncle.~0
151~474~This is certainly not your typical horror flick. Though it has some supernatural stuff going on there are plenty of quirky laughs to be found as well.~1
152~475~Trend setter, nostalgic, feel good hit~1
153~477~ Hollywood slickness and the energy provided by the stars, Bryan Cranston and Kevin Hart, keep the show running smoothly, but even this basic quality is undersupplied. ~0
154~484~Just another kids-in-peril horror flick that has flashes of inspiration but isn't distinctive enough to stand out from the pack.~0
155~487~Director Vlada Knowlton focuses on her home of Washington State which... allows for an interesting point of entry that is both regional specific and grassroots with nonetheless national connotations.~1
156~488~It runs out of ideas before it calls it quits.~0
157~492~Exciting, emotionally layered and brimming with invention.~1
158~496~The cinema of the teenage boy finds its purest expression.~1
159~499~Gwen is all atmosphere, a chilly feeling permeating through every corner of its expertly-curated frame.~1
160~502~[T]he narrative and structural choices of Serendipity present a certain distancing effect...~0
161~504~ Hogan gave better performances in the ring~0
162~510~Siblings Jonathan and Christopher Nolan's adaptation of the novel by Christopher Priest offers three acts of exasperating muddle.~0
163~512~" ""Burying the Ex"" is hilarious, icky, and smartly made, reinforcing Dante's gifts as a storyteller and his endearing appreciation for shock value and uncomfortable laughs. "~1
164~515~A stellar cast, skilled musical score composers, and a solid set of inspirations combine to little beyond an uninspiring drama at best, or a leery piece of pulp deserving of eyerolls at worst.~0
165~516~While the plot lacks a conventional narrative resolution, which would be inappropriate to such a story, the conclusion attempts to bring some levity to Benni's rebellions and her carers' struggles.~1
166~517~The gender flip turns After the Wedding into a decent feminist statement, albeit one without the edge of the original.~1
167~523~" Yet another insipid and cringe-worthy melodrama taking the ""it's all connected"" route while landing the biggest dissociative emotional belly flop of the year."~0
168~524~...not so much a story as a victory lap...~1
169~525~Despite its flaws, Rondo still has enough intrigue to make it worth watching once if violent crime thrillers flick your switch~1
170~531~Brought me no joy.~1
171~536~Like a bridal shower, it's probably more fun if you have some champagne first. Perhaps some enterprising theater manager will consider this.~0
172~537~Jim Gaffigan mugs as a dad with two families. A few interesting pieces, but it's basically a TV sitcom version of a British slamming doors farce.~0
173~539~ You will believe a chicken has teeth.~1
174~540~ Seductive yet unilluminating~0
175~541~It's a tale we've seen before but Mikkelsen imbues it with something entirely new.~1
176~546~... manages some moments of emotional honesty about starting over, although it sidesteps the creepy nature of Phil's scheme, preferring to pass off his actions as quirky charm.~0
177~550~ It's creepy, compelling and asks some interesting questions about the power of human sexuality.~1
178~558~Who would have thought that a real-life tale of sex, drugs and murder could be so instantly forgettable?~0
179~559~With such a promising premise that could have been strange but alluring, you're left with a confused and irritating feeling that nothing really made sense.~0
180~562~ Thankfully, director Sayed keeps it short, resisting the temptation to segue into melodrama. He sticks to a few montage scenes between Vidya and her daughter.~1
181~563~" Haley is a solid replacement for Englund as the murderous Freddy. He is particularly effective in the scenes of Freddy's earlier life. Although his talent was put to better use in ""Watchmen"" this role should give him employment for years to come."~0
182~569~It's a slasher film that only understands the simplest formula of the subgenre - stalk and kill - yet can't even execute such a minimalist horror architecture with staying power.~0
183~574~Raiders of the Lost Ark is my favorite movie. I don't have to tell you why it's great. You know why it's great. Instead, what follows is a list of very personal moments.~1
184~577~Whatever name you want to call O'Grady, he is fascinating and frightening.~1
185~580~The damage done in writer-director Francois Ozon's incriminating story is as sharply drawn as an assault.~1
186~586~This is a lush, deeply pleasurable film to experience on a sensory level; Almodovar couldn't produce a boring frame if he left the lens cap on.~1
187~595~There's still so much to love about Darlin', and during its heights it very welcomely stands in line with the likes of Ginger Snaps, and other teen-twinged horrors of that ilk.~1
188~600~Branagh's pacing, intended as idyllic I guess, is glacial... That said, the acting is magnificent, from Dench and McKellan and the other supporting players, but above all from the star.~1
189~603~ This is really just a standard, R-rated rom-com in cinematic sheep's clothing that follows the usual trajectory of the genre. (Complete Content Review for Parents Also Available)~0
190~606~ it's a thrilling, heart-warming adventure through all walks of animal (and human) life.~1
191~608~...nothing more than an endless festival of blood and gore, masquerading under the guise of a gritty modern science fiction fable.~0
192~615~ Number 37 is an impressive début which suggests good things to come from this promising young director.~1
193~616~A pretty but lifeless and witless confection, out of character for Netflix -- which has a decent track record in the genre.~1
194~622~One will never wish to go through precisely what White does, but losing one's parents is inevitable, and the film is a searingly authentic portrait of the process.~1
195~623~Between Two Ferns: The Movie is a competent film that delivers plenty of laughs, while never quite aiming for the high bar set by its source material.~1
196~624~Tells [the story] faithfully, but maybe not bravely. It's a competent film, it's an interesting film... but I don't think it digs as deeply as it could.~0
197~625~A glimpse into the hell of our secret selves.~1
198~627~Theron is the most convincing actress to play Aileen Wuornos ever and really dives into the role...~1
199~633~Queen of Hearts is genuinely one of the more engrossing movies I've had the pleasure of watching this year. Genuinely skin-crawling, with some terrific performances and striking visuals, it is a movie I won't be forgetting in a hurry.~1
200~635~It's not perfect, but it's not like any other movie in theaters now.~1
201~638~Fascinating insight into not only the making of a masterpiece, but the inherent inspirations that trigger such bold creativity.~1
202~639~A Brick-breaking, glass-shattering, emotion-grabbing first half, stalls, then tailspins into a complete mess. Ending is as bad as the openning is good.~0
203~640~The Imitation Game is impressive, particularly due to Cumberbatch and Knightley and the highs and lows of Turing's truly remarkable life.~1
204~641~ It's an adrenaline rush that tickles the brain cells.~1
205~645~A thriller that promises to start quickly and find a fresh twist or two by the end, and fails at both.~0
206~646~The Mandela Effect spends far too much time on dry exposition, leaving little room for character development or a compelling narrative.~0
207~648~... generates some mild tension, but Oldman's change-of-pace performance can't keep afloat a screenplay that's all set-up with no payoff.~0
208~652~ Thor: Ragnarok is more fun than a barrel of winged monkeys, but man, do we have questions.~1
209~653~a perfect hybrid of French noir elegance and the New Wave's rough hewn realism~1
210~656~Childhood curiosity clashes with dystopian peril in this science-fiction drama that supplies subversive genre thrills plus relevant subtext.~1
211~658~As it stands, the film can best be described as a gorgeous, convoluted mess.~0
212~659~This is a good-natured, bouncy movie, filled with good-natured, bouncy people, all existing in their own bubbles, where no one seems to need to go to work.~0
213~663~ It's fun enough, but this excellent cast shouldn't have to settle for a watered down version of what the guys had on their first outing. ~1
214~666~ An inspiring story of compassion and service in a program training rape victims to be community leaders. ~1
215~667~Would have been much better off if it had taken a moment to sit down and decide on its own sensibility... It might have settled on the one, and retained its focus. But it didn't, so it doesn't, and it tells us nothing.~0
216~671~A Space Program offers a vision of what The Martian might look like as directed by the heroes of Michel Gondry's Be Kind Rewind.~0
217~673~Bryan Cranston's swagger almost saves this clunky gangster movie.~0
218~675~The film doesn't need a heartfelt detour, especially any creation that contains a revenge scenario involving a urine-filled water balloon, and it disappoints me that the production didn't have the guts to assemble a more relaxed summer camp farce.~0
219~681~The one thing Hellboy has going for it, is that it's never boring. Trainwrecks tend to hold your attention that way.~1
220~682~Writer-director John Sayles has successfully tackled so many unexpected subjects that one has to wonder if he's got a dartboard in his office to help him pick his next topic.~1
221~683~ plodding and earnestly morose~0
222~684~SoulMate might have a familiar premise, hit some formulaic beats, and have a few pacing issues. But a movie is not just the story it presents, but also how it interweaves all the elements of film...the movie succeeds here in a way few recent films have.~1
223~688~Funny string-driven action satire.~1
224~689~Unlike the titular meal, there's not much substance to the nostalgic screenplay, even if the ensemble cast brings a heartfelt charm to the predictable material.~0
225~698~ La Vie en Rose is a life seen through a glass tinted darkly, with Cotillard glittering fiercely before the light goes out.~1
226~699~ There's little reason here for further misadventures.~0
227~702~[A] cute comedy drama inspired by a true story.~1
228~703~A series of less-than-hilarious set-pieces ensue, followed by a twist that almost nobody in the audience under the age of 11 will see coming.~0
229~708~Considering it ends up being a conventional and predictable rom-com, I wish 'Yesterday' had taken more advantage of its premise. [Full review in Spanish]~1
230~709~Buckley... confirms that she is a specialist in the untamed.~1
231~711~ This is top rate. It's funny, it's interesting, and there's just enough truth in there to make you mad.~1
232~713~This is a crude, R-rated farce full of promise, but Supervised is one word that doesn't seem to have been applied to the script.~1
233~716~It benefits from a willingness to move gently through its ethereal dream, mindfully accepting that quiet can be just as enticing to children as bright colors and rapid-fire gags.~1
234~717~Will Smith does an incredible job playing both the 50 year old Brogan and his clone.~1
235~723~ Sohn proves an extremely able documentarian, inserting herself among participants on all sides of the debate, from the police to activists and beyond.~1
236~724~Reuniting, or really, introducing, the gang is a gimmick. It's also self-destructive-cramming in all these characters chokes up the plot, and who watches a Step Up for the plot? ~0
237~725~ The interior monologues and intense detail of the book don't transfer well to the big screen. When a guy is this bored with himself, why should we argue otherwise?~0
238~728~It's fitting that there are so many good performances here since, in the subtext, The Return of Martin Guerre is a film about acting.~1
239~732~A remarkable film about a reindeer that will have you gasping.~1
240~739~ The film is well written and directed and makes you angry about the way young men and women are getting fleeced by people who run such programs.~1
241~740~[A] wonderfully mad odyssey of a movie, in which a man sets out to find his biological parents and winds up meeting more weirdos than Alice found down the rabbit hole.~1
242~747~I couldn't help but appreciate the fact that, well, this guy will do it; he'll go there.~1
243~750~This fun, fast-moving film is a directorial debut for Olivia Wilde, who helped polish a script kicking around for a decade-one written by four women, not to the detriment of its general cohesion and frequent hilarity.~1
244~753~Silent Hill renders the look and feel of the game with perfect clarity... But it's this unwavering fidelity to the source material that is also the film's biggest problem.~1
245~758~Shane Black was not taking this seriously whatsoever... It's even lit like a Goosebumps movie.~0
246~760~ Cooper nails the role of an American killing machine in Clint Eastwood's clear-eyed look at the Iraq War.~1
247~762~ This original concept, a gangster musical spoof with all the roles played by children (Jodie Foster among them), never found its audience, but it's worth checking out.~1
248~763~Unpredictable and refreshingly inventive, this flick certainly stands on its own as perhaps South Korea's kookiest contribution to the battle-of-the-sexes genre.~1
249~766~Until the mainstream produces some films undeserving of idiot violation, the idiot violation represented by Meet the Spartans -- a Xerox of absolute zero -- will be par for the course.~0
250~769~I connected on an emotional level with it the first time, but I suspect I may find it better on repeat viewings; there is a masterpiece in there somewhere, I just have to dig deeper to find it.~1
251~770~Directed with muddled confusion, the movie goes through its stock characters and obligatory plot points without enthusiasm or charm.~0
252~773~In addition to its armchair analysis, A Private War offers a lead performance that calls attention to itself. ~0
253~775~On a purely pictorial level, this is one of the best-looking IMAX movies ever.~1
254~778~One of the best films of 2019, The Day Shall Come is fast-paced and features far wittier dialog than most domestic comedies.~1
255~779~By the end, everything that was initially serious about the film becomes silly and everything appealing about it turns sour.~0
256~784~ One of the flaws of Paralta's script is that he wants us to feel SORRY for those poor kids who made all that money. Awwwwwwwww....~0
257~791~ ...an abject failure that just doesn't work on any level...~0
258~793~Corbijn has assembled a fine cast of performers, yet still comes up with a disjointed jigsaw puzzle. Playing unfocused spy games in A Most Wanted Man leaves this peek-a-boo thriller feeling tired and unwanted.~0
259~795~ A bland, so-so romantic comedy without the charm to see it through.~0
260~796~Miss Bala is a good time but it's not a good movie.~0
261~797~Matthew Glave shines in Michael J. Gallagher's uneven, but entertaining, dramedy.~1
262~804~Without the star charisma or narrative ingenuity necessary to propel its story forward, this one never lets audiences out of the waiting room.~0
263~813~Enjoy the spectacle.~1
264~814~ Clouzot fails in his metaphysical quest, but succeeds in producing a movie of uncommon beauty and provocation.~1
265~815~The second film to spring forth from J.K. Rowling's popular series of children's books goes a long way towards amping up the dramatic tension promised by the source material.~1
266~820~I appreciate the high-level creativity in the storytelling...although there's nothing new to see...~1
267~823~Don't expect much, in general, and you'll fall in love.~0
268~825~"Has this juvenile, punk rock vibe that mostly works really well-even if it is weirdly juxtaposed with some unnecessary serious comments about how violence actually is ""in real life""."~1
269~827~A friendly, joke-stuffed animated feature.~1
270~828~Charming tale of songwriter finding her voice has profanity. ~1
271~830~ Fails to provide enough action and story that doesn't shy itself away from falling to the tropes of a generic summer blockbuster.~0
272~833~Slate-like so many women-has more than one self, and she shows us a few of them in Stage Fright.~1
273~835~One can't help but admire a know-how that permits a generation of walking nuts-and-bolts to move effortlessly amongst men.~1
274~837~Seeds masterfully explores what happens when one cannot stop the dam from opening.~1
275~846~There's a plot in there somewhere, but most of the time it's subsumed by a frenetic attempt to showcase the whole Playmobil range in an extended kinetic eruption of primal sound and primary colour.~0
276~850~A run of the mill crime drama that does the genre well and also features Josh Hartnett.~1
277~851~ Cumberbatch's accent, in particular, is so minutely well observed that it deserves awards on its own.~1
278~852~I Origins tries desperately to imbue a deeper metaphysical meaning with its narrative, but the alignment of all its concepts come off as disjointed and pretentious.~0
279~853~It doesn't have great pretensions: It is raw, picaresque, and it presents extremely absurd scenes, but that work well within the convention that McG has created. [Full Review in Spanish]~0
280~854~The film does a great job in balancing the tone with many dramatic moments, while still preserving comedic elements that are very much a staple of people's day-to-day lives.~1
281~860~This is no siege thriller and the zombies aren't scratching to get in. The drama and conflict arises from the nuances of family dynamics and strangers getting to know each other under extreme circumstances.~1
282~863~ Firewall offers nothing new nor original. It is a retread, formulaic to the nth degree, with every cliché telegraphed reels ahead of when they occur.~0
283~868~Too bad the filmmakers felt compelled to give this sufficiently charming doodle some emotional heft by veering into Four Weddings and a Funeral territory. It only distracts you from The Wedding Date's own modest charms.~0
284~870~It's messy and frantic, with a lot of characters to keep straight, but it's also hilarious and involving.~1
285~872~The result is a story balanced enough to let its themes and outcomes speak largely for themselves, offering a lucid sense of who its people are.~1
286~876~The characters are brought to vivid life with remarkably compelling performances by two of the screen's most versatile actors: Don Cheadle as the freewheeling Greene; and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Hughes, the aggressively ambitious executive.~1
287~877~After all, Captain Marvel is a Marvel Studios film with significant ties to the U.S. military. While it's nominally critical of war, its hands are filthy with government propaganda.~0
288~878~Black Christmas ends up being a lump of coal with its poor screenplay and weak character development, even if it has some fun moments.~0
289~880~There's a lot of hokey fun in old pulp stories like Burroughs', but John Carter fails to capture any of that charm.~0
290~884~ It is a romantic comedy, released for Valentine's weekend no less, that is willing to look at the darker underside of dating~1
291~887~They have pretty nice chemistry. Jack Quaid is charming and overall I enjoyed it~1
292~894~ [The filmmakers] tap into the wonderful complexity of the material: Cancer is awful, but it's instructive and loving and funny, too.~1
293~895~ ... Matt Weiner's meandering feature debut resembles bad TV, or TV made bad by abbreviation.~0
294~896~ The uninspired script by Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow recycles the usual conflict between good-and-bad-guy scientists, government agents and private profiteers.~0
295~899~ Arguably Allen's best-looking movie in colour. The script does feel like it's been cobbled togther by a computer program, but at least a computer program with access to the Woody archives: if nothing else, there's no doubt this is a Woody Allen movie.~1
296~901~ This film's startling accomplishment isn't its multiple layers but the fact that you aren't yanked out of the story to admire the cleverness of American Splendor's construction; the film just feels right~1
297~918~What a sweet, gentle and feisty movie Evelyn is.~1
298~919~ Spider-Man: Homecoming is a funny, heartfelt, coming of age story that defly captures the awkwardness of being a teenager.~1
299~920~ A solid but infrequently spectacular addition to a rejuvenated franchise.~1
300~922~It foregoes the sap and the lowbrow of a lesser movie in favor of engaging creativity and a message that, through some characters' tough choices, actually resonates.~1
301~924~It's a lazy hero's quest adventure flick where the hero learns little and isn't given much chance to become a hero.~0
302~928~If it didn't star Julianne Moore, it would be well worth skipping. But the exceptional way Moore plays Alice, a renowned Columbia University linguistics professor with early-onset Alzheimer's, lifts the film above its morose potential.~1
303~933~ A nerve-wracking thrill ride with surprises, wit and no small amount of heart, Son of a Gun's full of genre excitement and promise for Avery's future.~1
304~946~The film is at its strongest when it's exploring the nature of manipulation and who, exactly, is manipulating whom.~1
305~950~ Despite this film's sharp dialog and terrific story, its bloated, undisciplined editing keeps it from being a classic.~1
306~953~" There is an incredibly emotional story to be told from this family's experience, but due to the weak structure and awkward third act, ""The Impossible"" fails to deliver it."~0
307~954~ [Hill] tries to infuse life into the proceedings. Unfortunately there is none.~0
308~955~ Harry Potter fanatics will have a field day pointing out the numerous omissions from the book.~0
309~956~The most special effect in the movie is the incandescent star power of Will Smith.~1
310~957~Like stumbling onto a new album and just being able to go along for the ride without ever needing to reach for the skip track button.~1
311~959~ Mistress America lacks the star power of last fall's While We're Young, but it has something more important - Greta Gerwig - and, largely for that reason, it's the superior picture. ~1
312~960~ Takes its time to get where it's going, but the raw feelings unearthed by writer/director Ruben Ostlund are frightening in their accuracy. ~1
313~967~"While I like seeing Terry Crews in a different and dramatic role and really like Ken Foree as his house-bound dad, BJ, the problem I have with ""John Henry"" is the bad guy"~0
314~971~It is is impossible not to be moved. Bales sometimes overeggs his Western saviour yet is watchable throughout, imbuing Miller with a nobility that is only explained in the final reel.~1
315~972~ Does it make me a Scrooge to suggest that this is one piece of holiday coal you should leave in your stocking?~0
316~975~Wow -- here's a smart movie that's as well-acted as it is well-plotted.~1
317~977~The world doesn't end with a whimper, but with ingenious laughter, making this off-the-chart genre-bending comedy the funniest and most original movie of the summer.~1
318~980~But there's room for a bigger discussion there, between two powerful women engaged in what is largely seen as a man's field, while Curtis and Sumpter are both extremely passionate in their few exchanges.~0
319~984~Biopic about artist's relationship with his bullying mother.~0
320~991~Made me long for the days when director Zhang Yimou made intimate movies with emotional depth.~0
321~992~Call it pretentious, but these two films are a tapestry of life where a spectrum of human existence is not necessarily examined but rather observed.~1
322~995~Still, this infectious high-in-the-sky thriller radiates with an exploitative off-the-cuff sly wink that's both calculating and campy.~1
323~996~Even with its sappiness, Hot Air is about family sticking together and finding forgiveness. It a breath of fresh air over the typical a one-sided partisan film.~1
324~1003~ Few other directors remain this madly prolific or entirely immune to their critical reception at 78. The trouble is his equal indifference to what distinguishes a decent idea from a dim one.~0
325~1007~...ultimately a slightly tarnished treasure; with the combined talent of its production team, it could have been great, but because of its clumsy writing style it has to settle for just being good.~1
326~1008~ Decent, but not great.~1
327~1012~ The problem isn't the timeline -- it's everything else.~0
328~1013~A story that focuses on the portrait of each of the characters, and a relationship subjected to dramatic dilemmas, which are interpreted admirably. [Full review in Spanish] ~1
329~1015~...will undoubtedly come under fire for being all over the place, but that's like complaining a trapeze artist shouldn't be performing so far up in the air. The movie exhilarates precisely because it takes random, high-altitude risks.~1
330~1016~Playful and energized enough to keep an audience guessing.~1
331~1019~Poor Joe Pantoliano, Kid Rock, and Joanna Cassidy get mixed up in the flatulence.~0
332~1020~ Broadcast News is a slick and well- scripted comedy, witty and well-paced; it makes no points that haven't been made before, but like its TV news team it makes them entertainingly.~1
333~1021~Rosamund Pike is an absolute wrecking ball here. She embraces this complicated character and gives it her entire soul as an actress.~1
334~1026~" ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is a comic book movie that crams in a stunning number of characters while still managing to map out significant emotional underpinnings."~1
335~1028~Feels as though everyone involved forced themselves to grit their teeth and get on with it. ~0
336~1030~ Even close to the end, one might have a hard time wanting a happily-whenever-after for this shallow woman and the sloppy but sensitive guy who probably deserves better.~0
337~1031~ Clint Eastwood and Leonardo DiCaprio are to be commended for wanting to make an old-fashioned biopic, educating people on an American legend. But did they have to make it so long, boring, and uninformative?~0
338~1035~An intense journey into the past of two brothers with an extraordinary story to tell. This left me speechless for hours. [Full review in Spanish].~1
339~1038~ Kurosawa's extraordinary direction drizzles a bit of psychological acid on everything, making it seem breath-stoppingly fresh.~1
340~1045~ A self-styled outsider artist comes into focus in Finding Vivian Maier, a striking documentary undertaken after one of its directors bought a nondescript box of photo negatives at a garage sale.~1
341~1046~The movie is well-made and likable, without any major missteps. It's also just a little bland.~1
342~1049~ Wiig's deranged but sympathetic performance carries a lot of the film's weight effortlessly ...~1
343~1051~The kids today, they want reality. Remember Beauty and the Beast? Remember how much better it was when that singing candlestick looked real? It was $1.2 billion better. Imagine that, but with lions.~0
344~1052~ Another one of those films better remembered than revisited.~0
345~1059~ Unlike the novel, which you can set aside and take a break, with the film version of Revolutionary Road, you're in for the duration, and it's ultimately too much to take.~0
346~1060~"Guy Pearce gives a riveting performance in ""The Rover,"" full of quiet rage, ruthlessness and single-minded determination."~1
347~1062~yet another harbinger that the total collapse of civilization as we know it has drawn just a little closer~0
348~1063~The second half of the film plays out a weak-kneed chase yarn that's staged and structured so halfheartedly you wonder why the filmmakers bothered at all.~0
349~1065~A refreshing change from the usual whoopee-cushion effort aimed at the youth market.~1
350~1066~The climax sent me out of the theatre scratching my head, and even though I enjoyed the majority this isn't exactly the sort of reaction I'm guessing the writer/director was hoping for.~1
351~1069~ The first summer movie that is both: a) truly comparable to a roller coaster ride; and b) significantly worse than a roller coaster ride.~0
352~1076~One woman, one gilled foe, one gorgeous escape ploy that rations tension as to sustain all 90-ish minutes.~1
353~1077~Jenny Slate: Stage Fright is funny, fearless, and phenomenal. It's a must-see that may make you feel seen. And if not, may still make you cackle like its charismatic comedian. Don't miss it.~1
354~1079~Asinine [and] illiterate. ~0
355~1081~Despite an intriguing premise, this film goes absolutely nowhere, opting for random gore as opposed to containing any real ideas.~0
356~1082~The film built around Depp's performance is leaden and monotonous, crusted in the faux-realism of handheld cameras, muddy streets, and dingy castle hallways.~0
357~1092~Murder Mystery is a lively hodgepodge.~1
358~1095~The film wants to aimlessly pander to the opposing sides of levity and heartbreak but fails to instill any genuine ingredients of grief, sorrow or reflection to go along with its weakened naughty streak of wit.~0
359~1101~[It's] gratifying to see [Aniston] play a woman who's had it up to here with making nice, and making do.~1
360~1115~MARRIAGE STORY breathes life into the hardships of having a parter in your life. It's a wonderful film that reveals intimate parts of our lives we may have trouble articulating. It may be a bit uncomfortable, but that's life.~1
361~1118~Much of the [film's] merit lies in the duel between its protagonists. [Full review in Spanish]~1
362~1119~ A film about a climb more daredevilish than Philippe Petit's tightrope walk. Brilliantly filmed by the climbers who are as good at cinema as in climbing up the face of a mountain.~1
363~1120~ Psycho is not a long film but it feels long. Perhaps because the director dawdles over technical effects; perhaps because it is difficult, if not impossible, to care about any of the characters.~0
364~1122~A brilliantly plotted, smartly directed, fiendishly entertaining merry-go-round.~1
365~1126~Not unpleasant. Not much of anything else, either.~0
366~1129~A childish film written from a grade school perspective with neither quality nor excitement.~0
367~1130~This is what family films are supposed to be like.~1
368~1136~ It's not clear where Gutierrez's interest lies, why this story matters to him, what he's trying to say.~0
369~1139~Like Smokey and the Bandit for a younger, more fly, urban generation.~1
370~1140~Tye Sheridan, in an unusual role, plays Bart well as a tech savvy young man with Asperger's syndrome. The young actor obviously studied well and is convincing. But is this film?~0
371~1141~ ...extremely well-written and well-acted, but it was far too politically biased...it reminded me of a Soviet or Chinese Communist propaganda film.~1
372~1144~ You can see every minute of New In Town coming at you like a train on a Prairie horizon.~0
373~1145~There is a sub-category of comedy ... in which we laugh at the hideously humiliating experiences of some poor sap. If this is your kind of humor, than this is your kind of movie.~1
374~1147~Even beautifully executed, formally flawless constraint does not quite suit Almodovar.~0
375~1148~The triumph of Still Alice is that it's not about an illness; it's about a person.~1
376~1150~ Serkis much more adeptly captures Kipling's serious themes.~1
377~1152~It's not damning with faint praise to say this is the best pro football movie ever -- and by yards.~1
378~1153~ As usual, Wiseman's scenes extend for long stretches, which can be an acquired taste for some viewers. Yet this time around, he ends his film with one of the most shattering sequences of his career...~1
379~1154~A promising B-movie thriller the filmmakers can never quite bring themselves to edit into this slow, cluttered picture into the lean little neo-noir it wants to be.~0
380~1155~A Most Wanted Man is a rare feature: a relatively smart take on the war on terror that doesn't devolve into ideological score settling.~1
381~1156~By the end, there's no easy answer for Baltimore's problems. Yet by focusing on real people who are trying to make a difference, Charm City humanizes the city.~1
382~1158~Nothing about the movie resonates emotionally.~0
383~1160~ Badly plotted sequel that sidelines Snipes but remains watchable thanks to serviceable action sequences, some witty dialogue and the performances of Reynolds and Posey.~1
384~1162~Meet the Parents is much too herky-jerky to be completely successful, and it follows each laugh-out-loud scene with one that is completely -- or is at least a bit -- cringe-worthy.~0
385~1166~ A patchwork, conventional, and oft-told story that's a whole lot sillier than was probably intended.~0
386~1167~Effectively feeds our senses with the chilling sights and sounds from within the camp to create a completely numbing experience.~1
387~1168~Gladiator is a movie that while watching, you can enjoy; for a while.~0
388~1169~[A] brash, crass, often mind-numbing ride.~0
389~1172~This story is best left on the page.~0
390~1180~Sure this is going to draw some comparisons to Bridesmaids - and understandably so - but still there are some great performances and touching moments.~1
391~1183~It feels like a missed opportunity, but perhaps is a blessing since Bandslam's dialogue is much more pat than Hughes's quotable writing.~0
392~1184~ It's the take on the genre that Linklater might have made - sensitive, thoughtful and pointed, and willing to think about the kind of people who work at a restaurant where the food has considerably less appeal than the servers.~1
393~1191~ Even Banderas' character feels like a cheap knock-off, who is not fit to polish the boots of Puss. ~0
394~1197~ With the film, Lee Daniels quietly pushes his talent for hashing out visceral, violent emotions into unexpected dramatic terrain.~1
395~1202~ [Its] humming industry and multi-pixelated craft come lit by a spark of something close to genuine enchantment.~1
396~1205~All Cold Creek Manor seems to be interested in, really, is packing as many people into the theatre as possible before word spreads and optimism is slain...again.~0
397~1209~A formulaic but amusing tale of a loser who becomes a winner by losing himself in the service of others.~1
398~1212~The family that spies together, stays together. That's the homespun philosophy behind htis rousing fantasy/adventure.~1
399~1214~A likable love story that keeps you engaged even when it's tearing a few dog-eared pages out of the romantic comedy playbook.~1
400~1215~Ice on Fire may not be a great piece of cinema, but it serves its purpose well enough.~1
401~1217~ I so wanted to say Phranchise Phred Approves Phantasm Phive, but I can't.~0
402~1218~ The first--and still best--version of the Cold War sci-fi, despite compromised ending that was imposed by producer Walter Wanger on the director to make the tale less downbeat and anarchic.~1
403~1219~Reid... delivers a strong showing as the teen in peril, but performances alone cannot bring a coherent time-line to a head-scratcher which ultimately doesn't make a lot of sense.~0
404~1224~Shot in crisp black and white, Nebraska seems simple at its start. But it's given incredible depth by its astounding cast.~1
405~1227~It's all presented with a lack of real emotion and in a hail of noise and explosions.~0
406~1233~Russell's smart, snappy script is delivered by a top-notch cast, including two thoroughly likeable and well-matched leads.~1
407~1238~Nekrotronic is a bizarre, fast-paced hoot, its slapdash devil-may-care storytelling dynamics oddly working for me more often than they did not.~0
408~1240~Hawke does an excellent job carrying it off. It could have been a stronger film, but I thought he was excellent.~1
409~1243~The history may have been narratively scrunched, but it's all the true lives of some powerful and unfortunate people. Very lush.~1
410~1246~Despite the weak story, Hanson commands a strong performance from Eminem and showcases both the rapper's newfound acting abilities and his musical talent.~1
411~1248~ [A] film that has spent an hour and forty-five minutes puffing itself into a battle for the Soul of American Democracy feebly hisses its way to a deflated conclusion.~0
412~1250~Steven Knight's film triggers agitation, frustration and exasperation. Matthew McConaughey does channel his inner-Tommy Wiseau in two scenes, so there's that...~1
413~1252~ Wrong, ugly and sad in so many ways.~0
414~1254~As for the film's own balance between conscientious goals and living for kicks, it's neatly done. The depiction of the pair's friendship is believable and good-spirited in a way that recalls Lady Bird...~1
415~1256~If you're expecting anything remotely deep or intelligent, you best stay clear as this sick-lit, doomed romancer delights in the bittersweet to the point of overindulgence~0
416~1257~ I ask myself, how can any movie that calls itself a horror film also be boring at the same time? You will find the answer in The Innkeepers.~0
417~1262~Though something less than a masterpiece of the genre, this good-natured skirmish in the war between men and women benefits from Hudson's thoroughly charming performance.~1
418~1267~"George A. Romero's Land of the Dead is a decent follow up to his classic ""Dead"" trilogy, delivering compelling characters, a thrilling narrative, and plenty of zombie action/gore."~1
419~1275~ You don't need to know your silly mid off from your square leg to enjoy Fire in Babylon, a riveting account of the glory days of West Indian cricket.~1
420~1276~ Might just be the 'Carol' and 'Blue is the Warmest Color' of 2016. The leads are enthralling, and the way the semi-rocky romance is handled makes this a perfect Sapphic date film.~1
421~1277~Most of the film is zippy, funny, and fascinatingly strange -- all qualities that are often lacking in some of the more bloated action blockbusters.~1
422~1280~[its] destination often feels undecided, but backed by terrific performances from the entire cast and some nightmarish ideas, Mortimer delivers an initially understated psychological horror that morphs into something much more monstrous.~1
423~1282~"John Mulaney &amp; the Sack Lunch Bunch excels at amplifying those weird moments of pre-adolescence, when you're trying to assert yourself more but aren't always taken seriously because you're ""just a kid."""~1
424~1291~The design is gawdy without the joy of camp. The pacing is manic. The editing is bizarre.~0
425~1294~ The Tim Burton-Johnny Depp combo comes in colors and whimsy, but lacks tension~1
426~1296~Tone-Deaf is a disaster when Robert Patrick is not on-screen, and even when he is on-screen it's only more of a watchable disaster~0
427~1297~It looks like most of the money spent in this project went to explosions, which are many and huge, and to acting salaries, at the expense of special effects and the script, which could have used a big upgrade.~0
428~1300~The problem is that your safety is guaranteed - everyone is too likeable for there to be any sense of danger.~0
429~1305~The Edge of Democracy is a history of parliamentary immunity and hidden recordings... And history, in Brazil, does not cease rewriting itself. [Full review in Spanish]~1
430~1306~"A ""holiday horror"" anthology that lacks any ""holiday"" or ""horror"" appeal."~0
431~1312~The Red Sea Diving Resort is built around a narrative with massive potential, but the movie never quite delivers, reducing it to a film that is merely adequate.~0
432~1314~Even if certain elements of the movie seemed familiar individually, the whole of the enterprise feels different. It's a different voice and approach, and different is good.~1
433~1318~It excels in showing how Armstrong remained calm and capable in some truly astonishing situations.~1
434~1319~A moving tribute to an extraordinary man.~1
435~1320~ With characters this drippy and dramatics this deadly, you'll end up rooting for the volcano to win.~0
436~1324~While you can pretty much tell where Crown And Anchor is going from the first scenes, it plays out with power and purpose.~1
437~1327~What we have here in From Dusk Till Dawn is Pulp Fiction with teeth.~1
438~1329~'A Dog's Journey' has more bite than you might think.~1
439~1331~High school... Vanessa Hudgens... kids making music. We know what you're thinking, but you're wrong.~1
440~1335~Worth the investment for veteran Costner's vintage performance and for the way in which the timely script dares to tackle some tough social questions in refreshingly-realistic, if perhaps politically-incorrect fashion.~1
441~1342~Albert Shin's Disappearance at Clifton Hill is a neo-noir told mainly in nostalgic colors, smoke and mirrors.~1
442~1346~ If Sofia Coppola were a dude making genre action movies to impress Quentin Tarantino ... those movies would be a lot like this.~1
443~1347~Boseman's performance comes bounding in with such wicked attitude, and such a showman's determination to give us a good time, it's hard to harbour regrets for long.~1
444~1348~This should be required viewing for today's droves of would-be memoirsts in film or any other medium, and otherwise is simply a must for anybody who likes great movies.~1
445~1353~The thrill of seeing good thieves at work, combined with the leads' chemistry and the tension building score, make for an enjoyable, if shallow, film experience.~1
446~1354~Improbably, Fessenden takes material that hews closely to Mary Shelley's classic and breathes new life into it, making a compelling, if a bit warmed-over monster movie.~1
447~1358~ But of [Hitchcock's] non-suspense films, I Confess may be his greatest triumph.~1
448~1363~ The movie squanders most of Dr. Seuss' idiosyncratic charm in favor of blaring overstatement.~0
449~1365~Elite Squad can't decide whether it wants to pull the lid back on what urban decay has wrought or simply open up a can of whup ass.~0
450~1367~"This film is an easy target for being misintepreted by those with an axe to grind in the ""me too"" era; a sadder truth is that its clumsy approach was most likely unintentional."~0
451~1369~ A maliciously funny and keenly observant movie.~1
452~1371~Black Nativity is a cut-rate musical melodrama that grafts overreaching references to black culture onto a facile family-values narrative.~0
453~1372~ Ferrell is at the top of his game, giving us a character who is utterly shallow, silly, and vainglorious, yet completely likable.~1
454~1384~A message that never gets old: On stage or in high-school hallways, sometime it's the losers that turn out to be the real winners.~1
455~1388~With an energetic but never breakneck pace, the film is steadily entertaining, especially when it finds comedy in the characters. The cheap gags aren't quite as funny.~1
456~1390~Throughout Jindabyne, I felt completely creeped out. From the disturbing opening to images of children killing animals, adults abusing each other, and a corpse, the viewing experience was unpleasant.~0
457~1396~ Finally, Negative Space.... is a joyful, inventive celebration about a son recalling how his father taught him the old school art of suitcase packing, the last of several standouts in this year's slate.~1
458~1400~ Rarely does the idea of death elicit the warmth and utter charm as it does in this documentary.~1
459~1401~The film attempts to explore the ramifications of an anti-Muslim atmosphere through an intimate lens of friendship, personal faith, and extremism. The results are mixed, but impactful.~1
460~1408~No matter how you look at it, Vantage Point is a letdown.~0
461~1409~ Replaces horror with gore, social commentary with carny freaks and black humor with R. Lee Ermy~0
462~1415~Perhaps the worst crime of VEROTIKA is that it presents itself as a horror film but never makes an earnest effort to create any horror.~0
463~1416~"I Origins"" slows down the longer it goes on, and the last half hour drifts into vagueness. The climax is dramatically inert and depends on the soundtrack to convince us that it's actually happening."~0
464~1428~The ugly fact is that Van Sant's recent modus operandi has crossed the line from 'groove' to 'rut.'~0
465~1430~There are so many diversions in Failure to Launch, it's as if the movie is bored by its own story.~0
466~1433~...About as entertaining as avian flu.~0
467~1434~A country music drama with a big heart but not enough focus, Country Strong tackles fame, artistic expression, addiction and love, although none of them deeply enough.~0
468~1438~The story invites anyone who has experienced a season of failure or a season of loss to find something to keep them going. That thing is finding your faith~1
469~1439~ For any age, it's amiable and harmlessly entertaining. And if I was a cool, intelligent boy or girl in my teens, I'd like it a lot.~1
470~1440~ Star Trek Into Darkness is a high octane but messily plotted romp, with solid performances papering over plot holes you could pilot a galaxy-class starship through.~0
471~1443~ Wirkola aims for camp but overshoots, causing things to feel less like Sam Raimi and more like Uwe Boll. ~0
472~1445~Sometimes this moodiness gets a bit much and eats away at one's patience with the characters, but overall this is an impressive piece of work, stepping beyond cynicism and finding a way to keep playing.~1
473~1458~This Southern-fried, darkly humorous trailer-trash exploitation crime noir revels in the greedy characters' idiocy and the deranged story's psychosexual luridness. ~1
474~1460~If you've seen The Hunger Games, Divergent or The Maze Runner, there are no surprises in this low-rent X-Men knockoff.~0
475~1464~Fans of the first will find some amusement in familiarity, but with such a comically able cast this is a missed opportunity.~0
476~1469~This movie looks and feels superb, it is pure couture cinema. But there is also a excess of richness and bombast and for all its sleekness I felt that the spark of emotion was being hidden, and there is a kind of frustration in the operatic sadness.~1
477~1470~ Not a great picture -- not by a long shot -- but the many and various parts of Finn Taylor's quirky black comedy do add up to something rather appealing.~1
478~1471~ The film is swift and gripping but rarely flashy or titillating; sympathetic to its anti-heroes without ever slighting their victims.~1
479~1473~Bodied takes viewers on a kaleidoscopic tour of battle rap culture, dropping dope rhymes and ill punchlines all along the way.~1
480~1478~There are also not too many leading men who are as charming as [Pio] Marmaï, or as scary.~1
481~1479~Filmmaker Juan Cabral presents a muddled philosophical thesis about identity, one that begins promisingly yet quickly loses its intrigue.~0
482~1482~ It's legitimately exciting. The car chase scenes are phenomenal. And Aaron Paul shows that he can very much carry a movie as the lead. About that plot, though...~1
483~1483~Premature is an extremely vulnerable portrait of a Black teen girl in love... It's also a necessary reality check for those who may have forgotten what real teen love looks like.~1
484~1484~"Aniston defines the term ""bored to tears"" with her portrayal of the morose ""Justine."~1
485~1485~This is a cheesy soap opera that dearly wants to be a country and western All About Eve. The songs aren't too bad; the dialogue is.~0
486~1489~A witty, fastidiously imagined adventure and a touching, sometimes troubling ode to the power of friendship. But it also demonstrates some of the problems that can befall a movie when its vast ambition and confidence outstrip its finesse.~1
487~1492~Overblown, overheated, overdirected, overacted, overlong and over here, in the local bijoux.~0
488~1493~ Single-mindedly action-oriented to the point where Milius's film seems relatively ruminative ...~0
489~1495~Aside from the great bits of martial arts ass kicking and the genuinely terrifying demons, Kim's film is a portrait of faltering faith and moral dilemmas.~1
490~1496~I was not expecting much from this movie, but it turns out to be a surprisingly good animated comedy. It will probably make my top 10 list for the year's best animated films.~1
491~1500~Some strong action sequences, a consistent treat for the eyeballs and an early glimpse of the future of animation.~1
492~1504~ Dismally contrived - with formulaic plotting, shaky camerawork, cliched dialogue and repetitive scenes.~0
493~1515~Enduring the tepid, cliched drug spiral of the film's first half earns you the reward of bonkers practical horror effects guts-n-gore set to epilepsy-inducing strobe effects and grimy punk music.~1
494~1516~...captures some remarkably frank assessments of the process from both camps.~1
495~1519~Even though it may not reach the heights of the films that have influenced it, it is certainly an enjoyable and worthy experience.~1
496~1520~ Would you like to watch Wilson and a young child urinate on each other in a rest stop bathroom? Thought not.~0
497~1522~There is still plenty of whimsy, colour and slapstick comedy present in The Angry Birds Movie to keep the adults relatively entertained and the kiddies -- who are more than likely to be the most entertained -- giddy with joy.~1
498~1526~" The film has a fatal messaging problem: it lambasts online group-think and ""hiding behind screen names"" while also glamorizing the game."~0
499~1527~Still worth seeing, as always, because of that amazing Sturges dialogue.~1
500~1528~ The very things that others love, the meandering, unfocused essences of the movie, were the things that I disliked. Variety is the spice of life, right?~0
501~1529~ Visually ravishing and all-but-impenetrable.~1
502~1531~ It rambles on for more than two hours, thumbing through genre touchstones like a drunk in a video store, serving up the occasional visual that sticks.~0
503~1534~Throw in a Game of Thrones-esque soundtrack, a menacing Wolverine and some chilling climate change exemplars and the result is a surprisingly captivating watch.~1
504~1540~ Hairspray mixes aerosol-light social commentary with its affectionate Cinderella story and adds just enough wink-wink naughtiness to keep the earnest melodrama at bay.~1
505~1541~ This is Clooney in high civic Syriana mode, telling us that we should stay involved and informed even though the system is hopelessly compromised and there's nothing anyone can do about it.~0
506~1542~Besides a few subtle morals such as loyalty and friendship, this was just kid-friendly cuteness and well-imagined work.~1
507~1548~It's about theft, all right...of your money, your time, and the devices of a dozen other trite Hollywood star projects.~0
508~1549~ Once in awhile, a reviewer's darkest suspicions about a film butt up against a sneaky pleasure in its incidental epiphanies. I confess to being conflicted.~1
509~1555~The pieces are all there... [but] I kind of would have preferred to watch the making of the movie than the actual movie.~0
510~1568~Graphic look into heroin addiction. Not for kids.~1
511~1570~ The makers of 'Footloose 2.0' can be faulted for actually sticking too closely to the original.~1
512~1571~Perhaps one day film will indeed change the world for the better, but for now, all we can do is watch and experience what's left of the experimental media of that time and wistfully remind ourselves of what we missed.~1
513~1573~"Like the speedy vehicles that can be seen throughout the film, ""Spy Kids"" moves at an agreeably quick pace, never letting up for such petty things as catching your breath."~1
514~1574~ any time the film deals with religion, it slips from introspection into near caricature~0
515~1579~An especially simple-minded, pandering piece of art-house entertainment.~0
516~1581~What can ever be known of the real Chris McCandless is well served on-screen in 'Into the Wild.'~1
517~1585~"Marvelous Taiwanese study of down-and-outers' survival strategies defines ""bittersweet,"" while managing to be effin' hilarious along the way."~1
518~1589~Jolie is the macabre somnolent beauty, practically sleepwalking through a fable with excessively hard-hitting aims and regrettably banal execution.~0
519~1595~What Women Want is a gal pal popcorn comedy with more laughs than you might expect from its silly Hollywood fantasy premise, largely thanks to Taraji P. Hensen and a hard-working supporting cast.~0
520~1597~ Devilish fare like The Exorcist and The Omen that rush to mind. Those classics had thrills and gore galore. This is just too tame to terrify.~0
521~1603~ 127 Hours is one of the great survival stories and easily one of the most inspirational, triumphal things you will ever see. You will walk out of the film not depressed, but elated.~1
522~1604~ A movie that manufactures its feel-good status without really earning it. There's nothing wrong with it that an injection of tension (or story) wouldn't improve.~0
523~1605~ Why is it that some actors or comics can indulge in potty-mouth, sexually and socially dubious raunch and get away with it while others simply make you cringe?~0
524~1617~An earnest but uninspired attempt to tell a strong story about the Puerto Rican people, this prison/revenge drama comes across as a serious soap opera, flat and full of overly familiar elements.~0
525~1619~"A Hundred Streets"" seems oddly unequal to the status of its charismatic name cast, headlined by Idris Elba and Gemma Arterton."~0
526~1625~ It's a character study in which little is revealed about the character being studied.~0
527~1629~... a nostalgic journey - fantastic and surreal... [Full review in Spanish]~1
528~1630~ Absurdist chronicle of a cosmic incident in the drab life of a slacker/stoner~1
529~1631~The taut editing and the kinetic cinematography which is intercut with real-life footage guarantee that the film replicates the tensions of the attacks. But without any singular direction, it articulates nothing more.~1
530~1633~ There Will Be Blood establishes itself as a film of Darwinian ferocity, a stark and pitiless parable of American capitalism.~1
531~1634~... no film lover can afford to miss this film... [Full review in Spanish]~1
532~1635~If the weirdest stuff in the film falls the flattest, like a couple of food-throwing scenes, I found the end unexpectedly touching. Turns out the filmmaker had one more 1980s-oriented magic trick up her sleeve.~1
533~1636~Carion creates suspense but discards various important characters without explanation and leaves us with a bunch of questions about what we've just witnessed.~0
534~1638~a moderately entertaining variation on the old gothic thriller~0
535~1639~Its pure beating heart and humanistic undertones make it somewhat of a standout.~1
536~1643~It all ends in tears, and much louder music, and a series of events that strain credibility to snapping point, although it could well be that by then you're sobbing too loudly to care.~1
537~1645~More often, the film skates along the surface of Brown's contradictory character. Now if it skated like Brown's dance moves glided onstage, that really would have been something.~0
538~1646~ It's very, very interesting but it's sort of like you've got to have that magic combination: you've got to have looks and heart.~1
539~1648~A madcap cat-and-mouse game that's exhilaratingly fun...and offers a darkly funny and satirical take on just how ridiculous the rich really are.~1
540~1649~ It's a small film but should provide a big launch for Jenny Slate. Now I want to see her in a comedy with Kathryn Hahn.~1
541~1654~podcast review~0
542~1658~If you want something to put on in the background while you clean, turn on Red Sea Diving Resort. The soundtrack will alert you to which scenes to watch.~0
543~1661~ The only real achievement that a movie as puerile and moronic as Adam Sandler's Eight Crazy Nights can claim is that it risks giving both Christmas movies and animation a bad name.~0
544~1663~There's a new action hero in town, and I'm sorry Yoda, but he isn't a CGI midget with bad hygiene and Miss Piggy's voice.~1
545~1664~"Not much more than a ""haunted town"" thrill-ride, with only a few plot points tossed in to keep things moving, Silent Hill truly is a feast for the eyes -- provided your eyeballs aren't too squeamish."~1
546~1668~This is a degrading movie for everyone involved with it. So badly written and executed it almost feels offensive for the culture it portrays. [Full review in Spanish}.~0
547~1669~It mirrors the first movie but it adds a femenist perspective to it. [Full review in Spanish]~1
548~1673~ This remake is a consistently funny pleasure, never quite as sharp or inspired as the 1984 original, but radiating such good cheer that comparisons between the two films don't much matter.~1
549~1676~Director Roger Kumble brings his rom-com charm to Netflix's first film that was primarily shot in New Zealand.~1
550~1678~There are sections that vibrate with avant-garde energy - Smith uses a lot of experimental film footage to set the scene...~1
551~1679~Citizen Kane, written, produced, directed and played by Orson Welles, is probably the most exciting film that has come out of Hollywood for twenty-five years. I am not at all sure that it isn't the most exciting film that ever came out of anywhere.~1
552~1680~[A] word-heavy, woke animation...The messaging comes with sledgehammer subtlety, the visuals offer a world of candy-coloured dullness and, despite a stellar voice cast veteran animator and director Kelly Asbury just can't bring the affair to life.~0
553~1682~Don't even bother renting the eventual video.~0
554~1683~What ultimately keeps The Riot Act from working isn't its villains but its hero.~0
555~1685~It's frantic stuff, slight and cheesy but endearingly French and undeniably funny.~1
556~1686~ The film backhands [Zellweger] by deeming Bridget as imperfect, essentially stripping the character of any pride in her physical appearance.~0
557~1687~ Timoner has shaped the incidents for a melodramatic effect, giving us good guys who prosper and a bad guy who self-destructs.~0
558~1692~While the film does have some stylistic and pacing faults, Elisa y Marcela is an emotional drama that sends an important message of hope to minority groups.~1
559~1693~Goddard does a good job of bringing the characters to life....a treat for the fans~1
560~1695~A fantasy story without much plot, of how one person survives loss and the apocalypse.~1
561~1696~ ...simply one of the best pictures of the year.~1

564~1704~Mother and son have an uneasy bond that should be familiar to anyone who has ever seen a movie in which a child's room has been preserved and locked tight.~0
565~1705~ A sensational claim, but it lacks hard evidence or opposing perspectives.~0
566~1707~Taut, original, and unpretentious.~1
567~1715~Wild Rose is never particularly surprising, but it's a familiar story renewed in a satisfyingly female-focused way.~1
568~1719~ There's no rhyme nor reason for the characters to speak and/or act other than to further the plot... the conclusion makes even less sense than the uninspired setup, satisfying no one and making viewers question their life choices.~0
569~1722~...a complete and total trainwreck of a motion picture...~0
570~1733~A notable effort. [Full Review in Spanish]~1
571~1734~ J.J. Abrams has raised the craft of rejuvenating a movie franchise to something like a fine art.~1
572~1749~ An injection of adrenaline straight to the eye - which isn't entirely a bad thing.~1
573~1751~A story both infuriating and complex as revealed by director James Marsh, who won an Oscar for his last film, the brilliant Man On Wire...~1

576~1757~ This grim psychological drama becomes ever more ponderous ...~0

582~1773~ a beautiful valediction by a great filmmaker anticipating his own departure, whose message is as profound as any in a majestic career~1
583~1774~ This is essential viewing for cinephiles and Francophiles alike, but others may find the three-hour-plus running time a little excessive.~1
584~1781~ This journey is a road to nowhere.~0
585~1782~A thoroughly mediocre slice of big-city criminality and shady doings, unredeemed by its two capable stars.~0
586~1785~ IT'S hard to figure out what's the most annoying thing about this TMNT reboot.~0
587~1787~Even the film's title implies that the thirty-seven seconds for which Yuma did not breathe when she was born define her entire story. We learn little about Yuma that does not relate to her disability.~0
588~1792~Luckily Hayes's film is trying to say something sweet and is even relevant to today. [Full Review in Spanish]~0
589~1794~Not even the burly sledge-hammer wielding Terry Crews can save this utter disappointment of a film.~0
590~1796~Fans of 'Ready or Not' and 'Extra Ordinary' have already seen this movie done so much better.~0
591~1799~... almost made me indifferent to the topics in question, as well as unfulfilled.~0
592~1802~The plot, already extremely overdone and unoriginal, felt super forced and unrealistic.~1
593~1806~The most inventive, humane comedy in ages, probably the best-directed action film of the summer, and easily the most intelligent science-fiction story in a year lousy with the things.~1
594~1810~ ...moves with the virile grace of a prizefighter.~1
595~1816~You want eye-rolling moments? This movie will detach your corneas.~0
596~1819~during the shark attack . . . the sympathy was not necessarily with the humans in the water~0
597~1821~ It has no idea whatsoever what tone it wants to adopt towards its subject matter, and even less towards the character of Philomena.~0
598~1822~This is an unfussy genre entry that seasoned fans will eat up, thanks to the no-nonsense attention to world and character building.~1
599~1823~A dark, engrossing and unflinching portrait of a dysfunctional family that makes Ordinary People and Murmur of the Heart look like a fairy tale. Trine Dyrholm gives a raw, brave performance.~1
600~1824~ As a sketch of life on the margins in a tatty seaside resort, it works well enough. As an action pic, though, it's just too slow, too long.~0
601~1827~ This is a movie that defies understanding even as it compels reverent, astonished belief.~1
602~1828~ Frozen River represents one of the best examples of the new trend for austerity and social realism in American indie cinema.~1
603~1834~ Director Lawrence ... gives the other characters a greater sense of development with the result that the movie doesn't come across as a Jennifer Lawrence Glorification Vehicle. ~1

607~1843~A portrait of an angry married woman who makes some questionable choices.~1
608~1848~ All the adults are complete idiots, of course, because no one seems to notice or care about how freakish baby Calvin is - the fact that he has a full set of teeth, for example -- not even the doctor who examines him.~0
609~1851~Worse still, any attempts at old-school suspense are crassly undermined by gratuitously gruesome scenes of violence and torture that are more suited to full-gore horror of the Saw franchise.~0
610~1852~Forget the story and go for the ride. 'War of the Worlds' is a great summer thriller.~1
611~1853~An example of a beautifully crafted and photographed, low-key thriller that doubles as a terrific character study about marginalized people.~1
612~1855~ Often entertaining, especially for those fans who loved The Lord of the Rings and have been waiting years to see more of Tolkien's Middle-earth onscreen.~1
613~1856~A ragged, raw, yet somehow vital first feature.~1
614~1857~ Another week, another glacial outing from the ever-expanding Coppola clan depicting the oh so beautiful emptiness of American teenage wildlife.~0
615~1863~Stuck in neutral, prizing oddity to a point where the effort loses all momentum and mischief.~0
616~1865~Tamra Davis, a musicvideo director with the well-received feature debut Guncrazy on her resume, might have really had something here had she settled on any one of the many paths the movie starts down.~0
617~1870~There is simply nowhere else to go with the Madea character, yet here we are again~0
618~1875~ Fun, creepy, unpretentious little haunted house rides like these are so hard to come by these days that slight overpraise is understandable.~1
619~1881~ The characters feel a little underwritten, but there's a lot to enjoy here...~1
620~1884~The film's top-notch cast are let down badly enough by the clunking screenplay, but they are entirely defeated by the ethical vacuum at its core.~0
621~1887~[Y]et another movie that takes a mentally challenged character and turns him into this kind of deity, this saint-like mascot who everybody else learns life lessons from.~0
622~1888~To pluck romantic comedy from the jaws of a social crisis is a laudable project, worthy of Preston Sturges, and it's a pity that this featherlight drama-written by Tom Hanks and Nia Vardalos, and directed by Hanks himself-should falter in its task.~0
623~1890~The result, an eye-popping strobe of flesh and blood, is as visually stunning as it is absurdly offensive, sure to thrill some while leaving others in a state of outrage-induced catatonia.~1
624~1892~Insightful and quietly furious.~1
625~1893~I laughed, and frequently. There are also images I can now never forget, and kind of want to. Is this what it was like for all those people I introduced, kicking and screaming, to Aqua Teen Hunger Force?~1
626~1895~... a preachy parable stylized with a touch of John Woo bullet ballet.~0
627~1899~Like Donnie Darko Raising Cain for a Fight Club up Jacob's Ladder, this mind frying, retina searing, penal gland pickling cult in the making should be sought out and seen on as big a screen as possible to be believed and best appreciated.~1
628~1900~"Not much more to say, ""Shadow"" is one of the greatest wuxia films of all time, an audiovisual poem and overall, a true masterpiece."~1
629~1901~ Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay is no political tract, but it can be surprisingly bold.~1
630~1903~Ambitious and cool, but also a tiny bit lacking in one key area.~1
631~1906~The movie is intended as an effervescent fizz; instead, it's a fizzle. What should have been a knockout punch turns out to be more of a gentle poke in the ribs.~0
632~1908~ Once Honnold finally begins his long-awaited ascent of El Capitan, ''Free Solo'' comes alive with breathtaking footage that looks jaw-dropping (not to mention gorge-inducing if you have even the slightest thing about heights).~1
633~1917~Hereafter tries to do what Crash did but without the superficial gloss, the charm or actors who can actually act. The result is desperately, eye-achingly drab. ~0
634~1919~The acting is uneven, but the film almost captures how Mapplethorpe was a visionary artist and openly gay man at just the right moment in history.~0
635~1923~ Unlike a Pixar cartoon that embraces as wide an audience as possible, Speed Racer proudly denies entry into its ultra-bright world to all but gamers, fanboys and anime enthusiasts.~0
636~1928~From the opening, adrenalin-pumping prison bus escape to a heart-pounding car theft aboard a fast-moving train, Fast Five throws it down from the jump.~1
637~1930~ Unfortunately, Blair Witch is far from being an antidote to rampant special effects over-dependence.~0
638~1931~" There's more drama, backstabbing, temper tantrums and shocks in The Last Stand than in a season of ""Dynasty"". So far, it's the best event movie of the year."~1
639~1932~By this point, the phrase 'Un Film de Almodovar' connotes a genre unto itself, as identifiable by its themes, character types and visual trademarks as a Western, Hammer horror movie or vintage screwball comedy.~1
640~1935~Bodied covers its bases with a certain self-awareness, heading viewers off before they can cry foul.~1
641~1942~"Paralyzing joys are the very heart of George Bailey's dilemma; they are, to borrow words from George's father, ""deep in the race."~1
642~1943~The filmmakers have made somewhat hokey, unbelievable material into something thoughtful and artful.~0
643~1944~ It may occasionally seem to be aware of its undiluted preposterousness, but that hardly eases the experience of sitting through its endless cartoonish action sequences and overwrought emotional payoffs.~0
644~1946~ should be taken as a piece of the extended universe fiction that you'll find in role-playing games, pulp fiction and paperback releases~1
645~1955~ Ocean's Thirteen is hack Hollywood garbage, the sort of film that thinks so little of its supposedly sure-thing audience that it never breaks a sweat. That's not cool; that's lazy.~0
646~1958~Lucas and Moore write some whiplash funny lines, and since the film is just a throwaway, you can enjoy it on a trivial synthetic revenge-of-the-nerd level.~1
647~1959~"The most memorable part of Miss Bala is when ""Los Ageless"" by St. Vincent plays during a party scene. That rules. The rest of the film, sadly, does not."~0
648~1968~ Jordan shows he is still a great storyteller by keeping the audience guessing until near the end. It falls short of greatness, though, partly due to poor casting.~1
649~1969~ With fishy-looking types at every turn, it's like a high-speed Murder On The Orient Express with more face punching.~1
650~1970~Contains more miraculous conversions than a revival.~0
651~1974~Still, in the Wayans Brothers tradition, a few of the vignettes are savvy and effective.~1
652~1975~ It is handsomely crafted, to be sure, but boasts little authenticity and zero credibility.~0
653~1976~An excellent top notch gem with beautiful direction courtesy of Sofia Coppola...~1
654~1981~ A rich but satisfying plum-pudding.~1
655~1982~This crime procedural is consistently fascinating as it charts the minutiae of the drug business -- but it also tries to be a bit too clever and neglects the characters in the process.~1
656~1984~ A good holiday movie for kids and adults. Although the story is easily understood by kids, there are plenty of jokes and innuendos that will sail right over most kids' heads.~1
657~1986~There's little sense of momentum or urgency, and everything reaches back rather than looking forward.~0
658~1989~While there are cliched moments and the odd didactic part, the film overcomes these issues thanks to strong characterizations and great performances.~1
659~1994~As a filmmaker, psychotherapist Bloch puts Germany, Israel and the Palestinians on the couch and lets them see the one awful memory that binds them - trauma.~1
660~1996~There are many joys to be found in Hancock, not the least of which is Smith's effortless performance...~1
661~1997~Like a politician courting voters, Welcome to Mooseport steers away from anything controversial, content to steer a safe, inoffensive middle-of-the-road comedic course.~0
662~1998~Anonymity might benefit the actors who endure the labored writing in this thoroughly misguided thriller, in which the titular characters lack depth and sympathy primarily because they're, you know, killers.~1
663~2000~ It makes you squirm in your seat - not because the angst of the young love depicted on screen is so vivid and relatable, but because these two people are so incredibly annoying together, you'd much rather see them apart.~0
664~2006~The film's ambiguous ending [is] frustrating but fitting.~1
665~2017~From the start, this ridiculous horror-suspense movie is fraught with nonsense and a head-scratching lack of logic; though it eventually goes crazily over the top, it's too late to care.~0
666~2021~"""Knives and Skin"" feels like the unwanted love child of David Lynch and Paul Thomas Anderson - a dozen different stylistic ideas going off in different directions, often canceling each other out."~0
667~2026~The very unnecessary Angry Birds movie now has an equally unnecessary sequel.~1
668~2027~"Inspired by a true story - yes, cataplexy is very real - from events in co-writer Chris Higgins' life, ""Ode to Joy"" is held together by an amazing performance by Freeman."~0
669~2035~ The result feels like a happy memory tainted by regret.~1
670~2036~It doesn't help that the plot is tortuous, and the resolution is an inarguable letdown. And yet! Mitchell's ambitions, observations, and moods make the picture a dippy blast...~1
671~2038~ 'Twilight' of the Body Snatchers, without much urgency or sexual heat. ~0
672~2039~Flawed crime comedy pairs sex with violence. ~0
673~2041~Always preposterous though never actually silly, knowingly funny without ever being self-conscious, Fast Five is a passable action flick that will more than entertain its core audience.~0
674~2047~"""Katie Says Goodbye"" is nearly 90 minutes of terrible things happening to the protagonist. Despite strong work from Olivia Cooke, it's painful to sit through."~1
675~2048~ The combination detective noir story, slightly adult humour, crazy toon characters from both Warner & Disney's vaults (a one-off which is unlikely to ever repeat) and overall technical wizardy yielded a film which set a precedent.~1
676~2049~An essay on family, and life, by two of the greatest living actors.~1
677~2052~There is nothing explicitly wrong with The Tomorrow Man. It's just flat like a day-old soda. Lithgow and Danner are old pros, but they are unable to develop any chemistry.~0
678~2055~There is plenty of crowd-pleasing stuff - bits about trying to explain racism in America to his white Danish girlfriend as well as topics he has addressed before, like the unfair burden of contraception placed on women.~1
679~2056~ The real thrills in V for Vendetta come in its dense and vividly detailed plot.~1
680~2058~ So bad it isn't even good-bad.~0
681~2060~[A] sad, exquisite film.~1
682~2061~ There are some funny bits and characters around the edges of The Incredible Burt Wonderstone, but its core is empty of humor.~0
683~2062~Over-familiar, but still revelatory, amusing and at times -- quite moving.~0
684~2065~"Its only aim is to make us jump, make us laugh, and send us off with a thrilling final shot that's everything a ""Cloverfield"" fan could want from a prequel."~1
685~2068~What exactly is being satirized when a priest has diarrhea?~0
686~2070~ Eric Styles and writer Camilla Leslie have made a punishingly unfunny trifle about sex, love and maternity in which both women and men are flatter than magazines--walking, talking issues of Lady's Home Journal and Maxim.~0
687~2072~This is where I Am Mother distinguishes itself - bypassing doomsday to what happens in the aftermath, and how we come back.~1
688~2074~ [Director Jim] Jarmusch, as ever, has the power to sneak up on you. He's a spellbinder. The same goes for his movie.~1
689~2075~Never before have two such skilled actors been so monstrously squandered in a movie so replete with failed gags and pathetic gaffes.~0
690~2076~It may not convince viewers that the film is cursed and they're going to die after watching it, but its commitment to the gimmick, its ethereal score, and its eerie imagery make for a creepy and effective throwback horror film.~1
691~2081~One will not enjoy the movie as much as Diane Keaton perhaps enjoyed doing it. [Full Review in Spanish]~0
692~2082~ ...a small, grown-up movie for people who want a breather from all the current blockbusters, cartoons, and dumb comedies. ~1
693~2085~The material it does pull off is daring and sharp.~1
694~2088~ A mirthful comedy certain to send audiences into multiple spasms of laughter!~1
695~2091~ Director Paul WS Anderson has stripped out the satire and black comedy of Roger Corman's 1975 original and left us with just a straight homicidal Grand Prix.~1
696~2094~It's all very cute, though not terribly funny if you're more than six years old.~0
697~2100~" Poignant, ""I Kill Giants"" uses fantasy elements to grab viewers and discuss the effect of tragedy on the youngest among us. It also reminds us of the importance of creativity and imagination as a device to deal with life's difficulties."~1
698~2101~Boyer makes for a fine lovable louse, giving the film gusto.~1
699~2105~" It's hard not to derive some pleasure from watching Neeson fling himself about a rickety commuter train (and, in one set piece, precariously close to some train tracks), throwing insults at Goldman Sachs ""on behalf of the American middle class""."~1
700~2109~ ... slight and sweet as a meringue~0
701~2118~ (The film) is beautifully acted by Cheng and Whishaw and is often genuinely moving. To its detriment, it is very slow-paced and I found myself increasingly frustrated by (Whishaw's character's) tiptoeing approach the longer it goes on. ~1
702~2122~The plot here is simple, with room for just a few snappy twists, but what makes the film work is the combination of its very deliberate style and the supreme confidence of its delivery.~0
703~2125~ I can't get Enemy's peculiar, fevered mood, or the memory of that wackadoo last image, out of my head.~1
704~2128~A moderately engaging satire, some of it amusing and some of it strained, but in considerable measure it reflects a strange circumstance in all our lives.~1
705~2133~While comprising a fine cast... this feature debut by the writer-director team of Britt Poulton and Dan Madison Savage never quite seems to fully catch fire...~0
706~2134~[T]here is an undeniable warmth and tenderness to Fanning and Smith's performances that makes this a worthy, if not particularly memorable, addition to a thriving sub-genre.~1
707~2135~It's remarkable how all the moving parts of Static Cling coalesce in one perfectly paced, thematically coherent special that's still consistent with the old show's appeal.~1
708~2137~ Deadpool 2 is an outrageous, surprising, hysterical, emotional, vulgar, creative and uproarious summer blockbuster that fans of this genre -- and of comedy, in general -- will devour.~1
709~2139~ Movies like this make Cupid want to change careers.~0
710~2141~Despite its flaws, First to the Moon is undeniably great.~1
711~2142~The problem is that integrating so many characters ends up turning the plot into a real disaster. [Full review in Spanish]~0
712~2143~ Meaningless violence incarnate, a pointed mix of laughs and wanton death; and yes, that might actually mean something, but precisely what is never clear.~0
713~2145~ So quick bright things come to confusion. ~0
714~2146~ King's Ransom deserves to be bashed, burned, and have its ashes scattered over Hollywood~0
715~2150~Not all the gags are inspired and the excessive swearing can feel like a substitute for actual jokes, but even if this isn't solid comedy gold, it's still much funnier than a lot of other fluff.~1
716~2152~The joy of director Grant Sputore's debut lies less in the actual plot than in the breakout performance by Clara Rugaard, the affecting work of Hilary Swank, and the ideas the film plants in the mind of the viewer for further examination.~1
717~2156~Harrison Ford is one of the most likable and convincing of movie stars, and he almost pulls off the impossible in Air Force One.' I don't mean he saves the day; I mean he almost saves the movie.~1
718~2158~To borrow a phrase the film's con artists are prone to saying, American Hustle works from the feet up, and the fun is intoxicating.~1
719~2160~This umpire calls Hardball out at first base.~1
720~2165~ Completes possibly the most improbable cinematic hat trick in Hollywood history: An unpromising series that began with three patchy, uneven entries has now produced three terrifically entertaining ones.~1
721~2169~ The beauty of this film - like the two before - is its natural flow of conversation and ability to engage and transport us into the moment~1
722~2171~ An inferior effort that fails to do justice to both its central character and provocative premise.~0
723~2173~It's hardly subtle, but it's also never excessive.~0
724~2177~Had Geraghty's script leaned more into this concept, there's no doubt in my mind that The Host could've been exceptional. But I'd be lying if I didn't admit that I was entertained regardless.~1
725~2180~It remains fierce work with stretches of fascinating stillness, adding a little curveball when it comes time to explore the engine that drives self-preservation.~1
726~2182~While far from perfect, it deserves some attention at least for Sweetser and writer/director Devon Parks, who does much with little and constructs an interesting, sometimes assured narrative.~1
727~2191~With a constantly shifting chronology, the filmmakers find and link the key moments in the life of a brilliant, complicated, fascinating man.~1
728~2192~Frankenstein's Monster's Monster, Frankenstein is an ambitious spoof, and Harbour is a likable comic actor, fully committed to this type of weirdness, even in moments when it doesn't quite work.~1
729~2193~It has monsters doing/saying weird things and humans acting like huge jerks but when that's all you've got for 87 minutes, the novelty quickly wears thin.~0
730~2197~There's messaging inserted near the start of the end credits for those who might be affected by the themes raised. But it doesn't negate what comes before it: a film that lingers briefly in the deep end but remains disappointingly shallow.~0
731~2198~Dan Mazer's film about a couple who got married too quickly is both funny and plausible, if slightly constricted by its romcom template.~1
732~2199~Truth is, if Disney had a little more guts, they would have made this a trilogy, and given it the care that other major fantasy epics receive.~1
733~2200~Could we be ready to stop snickering about it and admit to its status as a modern classic?~1
734~2201~The producers of movies based on video games must think their audience is nothing but easy-to-entertain morons. It's the only explanation for a movie this dark, dull, and dumb.~0
735~2204~ The BFG is visually stunning and laugh-out-loud funny at times, but lacks the beloved bite of other Dahl film adaptations.~0
736~2205~Despite some clever twists, these intercut stories bog down in dense narration and tangled perspective, diminishing the emotional impact.~0
737~2207~i just hated every single character soooo much~0
738~2212~ The actor suffered deeply, and however much he's responsible for that, it's hard not to feel some compassion for a bright and sensitive artist who, at least early on, seemed full of life.~1
739~2214~The laughs come thick and fast in a sprightly kid pleaser full of slapstick set-pieces and memorable characters, while more grown-up viewers will find themselves grinning at pastiches of the Cold War paranoia of bygone sci-fi movies.~1
740~2217~ Retains powerful examinations of denial, but it seldom pieces together smoothly, often resembling four features running at the same time. ~0
741~2220~ The transition from slapstick humor to wide-eyed wonder (and back again) is clumsy, and none of the movie's emotional epiphanies feel earned.~0
742~2222~It's actually quite harmless, and, at the end of a very long, slow, uneventful journey, it has an excellent message. I just wish the point could have been made with a little more panache.~1
743~2224~It makes for a satisfying summer moviegoing experience.~1
744~2231~Shifting gears to a softer, gauzier mood, Clint Eastwood's Hereafter finds the masterful icon charting new terrain.~1
745~2235~Aside from the lovely, iconoclastic theme, Christopher Robin is simply a warm, fuzzy hug of a film that the whole family can enjoy.~1
746~2237~ Match Point crafts the beginning of a better than average fish-out-of-water tale, bores us for an hour with a milquetoast affair, then gives us a wild sucker punch of an ending that even a Nostradamus / John Edward tag team couldn't predict.~0
747~2239~ ...a delicious, meaty dish~1
748~2245~Primal simply refuses to dive into the wackiness of the premise, and a generally straight-faced presentation is not what most people want from a movie that features Nicolas Cage, Famke Janssen, a homicidal maniac, and a bunch of wild animals on a boat.~0
749~2247~Feminist and anti-racist to the bone, Ocelot's latest film is a startling, if misshapen, gem that will hopefully find an audience despite a modest release schedule.~1
750~2251~The actors are appealing, but the movie is clichéd from start to finish.~0
751~2253~ The best way to describe Into the Storm is that it is weather porn.~0
752~2255~This is survivalism stripped down to its bare essence, free of sentimentality, thematic pretensions, and unnecessary narrative devices. Arctic  delivers man-versus-nature conflict at its most elemental.~1
753~2261~Gemini Man is a movie that wanted to be more but ended up being a video game you can't play.~0
754~2264~ Despite some energy and inventiveness, the film is stuck in a mostly listless zone between taking itself too seriously and having fun with its exploitative elements.~0
755~2265~Arash Amel's excellent screenplay also includes a cogent description of post-traumatic stress disorder.~1
756~2267~ A beautiful piece of work: heart-wrending, atmospheric and truly poignant. Recommended.~1
757~2277~ A visually arresting and worthy tribute to a genius.~1
758~2278~" ""Allegiant"" remains cold to the touch, plastic, and dull, becoming another lackluster step in this laborious and unfulfilling cinematic journey."~0
759~2279~The film itself is so riddled with cliches, stereotypes and improbabilities that word of mouth is sure to limit the movie's prospects.~0
760~2288~It's a movie that wears the trappings of the countercultural movement like bunting, yet is essentially mild-mannered and rather conventional.~1
761~2294~Moviegoers can feel the pain of the characters, and not in a good way, in this mournful drama that squanders a first-rate cast.~0
762~2296~ Widows truly gives Viola Davis the leading film venue worthy of her talents and gives female characters the space to play a dirty game. The story is very ambitious with its twists and turns, but McQueen rises to the occasion and executes with flare. ~1
763~2300~ The film pays scant attention to [its] stated goal, relegating the discoveries achieved by Cameron's mission to a brief on-screen title at the very end of the film.~0
764~2301~ When not downright creepy, it's quietly damning of an administration willing to point all the wrong fingers and play up all the wrong angles before brushing the matter aside.~1
765~2305~Jennifer Aniston is the essential girl next door in this down-to-earth, witty film of small town desperation.~1
766~2311~An interesting, if not completely satisfying, drama.~1
767~2312~An unadventurous film that has only the smallest of fires in its belly.~0
768~2313~ A middling, overly predictable comedy.~0
769~2317~Earthquake Bird meanders through its plot points in a narrative that feels lost in translation.~0
770~2321~ It manages to be both timeless and perfectly of the moment. ~1
771~2322~ Honestly it would be nice if on occasion a film like this at least tried harder than making the main character somewhat dissatisfied and assuming that would be enough to get everyone identifying with her.~0
772~2324~"Routine ""woman-in-jeopardy"" thriller has suspense, violence."~1
773~2326~ An English-language remake of Juan José Campanella's far superior Argentinian thriller.~0
774~2327~ Verhoeven brings valuable lessons he learned working for 20 years in Hollywood to forge an unprecedented World War II-era masterpiece.~1
775~2329~This was a tough movie to sit through...this is a proper thriller, with each beat and moment landing...~1
776~2331~Mom and Dad Save the World is an insult to the idea of children's entertainment.~0
777~2336~ ... a gloppy miasma of goo, blood and annoying sound effects.~0
778~2343~[A] bold adaptation.~1
779~2351~Businesses destroyed, lives shaken to their core, the cars of bystanders crushed, cops helpless to stop it - it's awful and tragic, sure. But it's something to see, man.~1
780~2352~A pastiche of Cronenberg, Lynch, and Japanese horror that never reaches the height of its promise. In this case, the whole is less than its parts. [Full Review in Spanish]~0
781~2354~ It takes approximately 15 seconds for Accepted to begin showcasing Mac products, a somewhat foregone conclusion given star Justin Long's stint as the face of Apple computers' recent ad campaign.~0
782~2361~It all sounds intriguingly mysterious, but in play it's a frustratingly wrought sequence of vague weirdness that seems to be weird for the sake of it, until finally it has to somehow end.~0
783~2363~Such an important theme seems to promise a narrative indigestion, but Shultz is gifted with synthesis and an unusual intelligence to change tone between an artificial nightmare and a liberating dream. [Full Review in Spanish]~1
784~2368~For a movie about making vast new discoveries, this science-fiction drama explores a pretty familiar path.~1
785~2379~'The Kid' is a solid, violent Western.~1
786~2385~ It shouldn't be surprising that Pixar can make a sequel that retains all the charm of the film that preceded it. After all, they've done it before.~1
787~2386~Chappelle is fascinating, sophisticated, and what sets him apart, fearless.~1
788~2388~ The likeable characters and silly situations create a few genuine laughs and the liberal sexual content (by American standards) is surprisingly refreshing.~1
789~2391~Even Tigger was unable to add some spring into this film's step. ~0
790~2393~ Not only the most satisfying motion picture Romero has made in a long while, but one of the best of his career.~1
791~2395~...the combination of bland characters, poor pacing and the lack of campy fun doesn't offer enough appeal for casual viewers. Critters Attack! is strictly for hardcore fans.~0
792~2398~ The price of Gere's good looks is his acting skills don't quite match them.~0
793~2399~Certain moments either diminish the intellectual arguments at the core of the film or serve to further prove Bland was once here and now a specter looming over a never-ending, polarizing ongoing national conversation on racism and policing in America.~0
794~2403~The weirdness of it all is reasonably compelling, watching Barron return to the genre that secured his career, locating a different corner of comic book destruction to explore.~0
795~2405~A tale of familial trouble in America's heartland that's actually quite well-made but too slow and inert to carry much emotional pull.~0
796~2409~Elisa y Marcelia from Spanish director Isabel Coixet will leave audiences underwhelmed.~0
797~2416~Amnesia might not be so bad after viewing Secret Obsession~1
798~2424~Another mediocre entry in the saga. [Full Review in Spanish]~0
799~2427~Consider this one stillborn, and put your faith in better horror offerings to come. The real devil is ever having to view this movie.~0
800~2428~ The biggest mystery about Don't Say a Word is how a cast this talented managed to find itself in a thriller this routine, implausible and uninvolving.~0
801~2432~Jolie displays a here-to-fore untapped comic ability.~1
802~2433~"Embrace of the Serpent,"" a fantastical mixture of myth and historical reality, shatters lingering illusions of first-world culture as more advanced than any other, except technologically."~1
803~2435~ Your eyes may well manufacture some saltwater of their own as the story winds on its unpredictable, ever-heart-melting path. ~1
804~2440~" ""Kill Order"" isn't terrible, but it will likely appeal more to those who prefer their martial arts mayhem free of such contrivances as fully-realized characterizations, skilled plotting, and a satisfying tone. "~0
805~2444~A throwback designed to satisfy those with an insatiable craving for a grindhouse cover version of John Carpenter's greatest hits.~1
806~2445~A bland script that relies on cheap jokes. [Full review in Spanish]~1
807~2447~ The movie may serve to bridge the huge Grand Canyon-like chasm between baby boomers on one side and Gen X and Y'ers on the other, stimulating meaningful discussions about values, viewpoints and ideas.~1
808~2449~ When you live in the city and you buy your meat wrapped in cellophane, it's a pleasant fantasy to believe that people who sleep in the dirt and gut their dinners are possessed of a spiritual richness that you've always felt you're somehow lacking.~0
809~2450~ The film celebrates the NYPL as a vital service for the city and local branch-catering neighborhoods as a space for education, culture, and community. ~1
810~2454~Frankenstein's Monster's Monster, Frankenstein is a wonderfully absurd and surreal comedy, which satirically captures the story of Frankenstein.~1
811~2455~Those anticipating something more traditionally calibrated will likely be disappointed with the film's muted thrills and noncommittal denouement, but the elegantly composed film nevertheless makes for a creepy, contemplative entry in the Cristofer canon.~1
812~2456~'The Incredibles' deserves a place on the top rung of family films.~1
813~2460~ It's a cult hit already. Be there or be square, baby.~1
814~2461~In the end, Fincher's brilliant film is, ironically, short in the cojones department.~1
815~2462~This dunderheaded mix of sci-fi and medieval skull-bashing should have been called Monty Python and the Holey Time Machine.~0
816~2465~Spy Kids achieves the one thing Hollywood struggles to do in live action: It's a family film that's cool.~1
817~2474~[I]t's so refreshing to see a thriller that doesn't compromise itself with a pat Hollywood ending.~1
818~2476~Slow start, senstational ending: a decent job. No The Lord Of The Rings, but no The Phantom Menace either.~1
819~2479~ A thoroughbred cast ... flounders frenetically with sweaty desperation.~0
820~2484~ Bill Murray is the one of the greatest screen Scrooges in this 1980s updating.~1
821~2485~Green succeeded in creating a beautiful, neat tapestry, weaving together the loose threads left behind by Guy-Blaché, helping to reinstate her in the history of cinema.~1
822~2486~" Will Smith's latest Oscar-chasing provocation of existential platitudes and placating pabulum is trying to be a contemporary ""Christmas Carol."" Instead, this odious, distasteful drama just winds up emphasizing the ""dick"" in Dickens."~0
823~2487~Unconventional in nearly every way in its voyeuristic fantasies of high fashion and sexual fetishes, original arthouse horror done right.~1
824~2488~ Creates a world so lively and well-wrought I'd happily see a dozen more movies set there. ~1
825~2489~Helen Mirren and Sergio Peris-Mencheta shine in this otherwise tawdry tale of legal Nevada brothel.~1
826~2491~It's a movie well made for its target audience.~0
827~2493~It meets expectations with the help of a compelling cast, who elevate the material with their performances as the world falls apart around them.~1
828~2500~Brutal, over-the-top violence in Spanish war drama.~0
829~2510~A wildly expensive movie full of computers, nonsense and violence, a film where wit, romance, elegance - everything - is sacrificed on the altar of giganticism, cliche and over-the-top action.~0
830~2511~"""Crown Vic"" doesn't sustain a level of suspense and grim analysis throughout the entire endeavor, keeping the picture uneven, but still connecting with undeniable moments of clarity."~1
831~2512~The movie as a whole is a leap backwards, assembled out of a story as thin as noodles, and stunts so overproduced and bloated that they leave us staring on in disbelief.~0
832~2513~The film's several layers hold one's attention, from the chemistry between Christian and Marion to character developments both tragic and otherwise.~1
833~2518~ T2: Trainspotting is unsurprisingly disappointing, even though a strong third act proves that it isn't a total waste of time. ~0
834~2520~A.T White's Starfish is a film that has brilliant production values for a low-budget sci-fi film. But it's far too self-contained in its representation to really make its own place among a sea of seen-before advents.~1
835~2521~Often too concerned with how smart he's being, Sean Penn gets the quiet moments right while some of the more dialogue-intensive come off poorly.~1
836~2524~It says something when a two-year-old is the most mature character in the film.~0
837~2526~ Simply put, they are not very interesting or intelligent people. They're just a bunch of rudderless nitwits drifting down this lazy and chaotic river of a movie.~0
838~2532~Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice is wholly a tribute to a performer, an artist and a pioneer whose story is as textured and interesting as the songs she sings.~1
839~2536~It's when the action slows down that you can feel the brain cells dying.~0
840~2537~ I guess we'll have to agree that most sitcom films are a mistake -- dreadful, ugly, sprawlingly self-interested sewers of comic neediness featuring angry past-it comedians who hate you because they have failed in Hollywood.~0
841~2544~ Small-town scenes are the movie's best, and come closest to finding the elusive human connection that the series lacks.~0
842~2545~A charming, entertaining and enjoyable little film.~1
843~2548~There is a gentleness and simplicity to the adventure-seeking vibe of Playmobil: The Movie that will work particularly well for very young audiences.~1
844~2549~ If you're as happy listening to movies as you are watching them, and the slow parade of human frailty fascinates you, then you're at the right film.~1
845~2550~Roll Bounce has plenty of affectionate humor to balance some serious heart-tugging. And as for the roller-skating, it for sure provides a lot of razzle-dazzle action with lots of virtuoso terpsichorean touches.~1
846~2553~ Incredibly unfocused and strangely impersonal, relying almost entirely on hackneyed visions, dreams and flashbacks to forge any kind of emotional connection with the audience.~0
847~2556~If you want to find out how much scope the Old West contains for jokes about violent bowel movements, this is very much your movie.~0
848~2557~An uneven piece about 'trigger issues' in one man's professional and personal lives, but the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, if only by a slight margin.~1
849~2558~ Holdridge is clever enough to keep his characters from slipping into outright narcissism, or when they do, he's familiar enough with the art of mainstream moviemaking to balance the exhausted with the ecstatic.~1
850~2559~I found the film fascinating.~1
851~2565~ While John McEnroe: In the Realm of Perfection may ultimately be a character study, there's more to tennis than just hitting a ball across the net.~1
852~2568~The filmmakers make characters crasser, ignore nuances within geisha tradition and give characters attitudes and dialogue highly unlikely for Depression-era Japan.~0
853~2570~Mars may need moms, but Earth needs good movies, and this isn't one of them.~0
854~2572~A stoner's delight that is part fever dream and part bad trip, Inherent Vice is a dark and wickedly wild neo-noir romp. But it's also a thing of unusual density and often incoherence.~0
855~2573~ While it is satisfying to see retribution on those involved in the assault, there is an underlying emptiness to the conclusion.~0
856~2574~[A]n incredibly tiresome chronicle of Moondog's dissolute, promiscuous lifestyle, which he is able to afford only because his wife Minnie (Isla Fisher) is richer than Croesus.~0
857~2577~Ansari's special is funny, although the tone and delivery of it are less animated than his earlier material; he sounds tired at times, even when he starts laughing.~1
858~2582~The thing is that this film doesn't understand that telling stories is more serious and complex than it seems. Meaning, the movie doesn't know how to do it and I don't intend to recommend it. [Full Review in Spanish]~0
859~2584~An entertaining and of course forgettable film. [Full Review in Spanish]~1
860~2585~The movie's occasional narrative shortcomings are offset by the performances, which are uniformly fine.~1
861~2589~ An Elizabethan-era version of the madcap energy, penny-novel intrigue and intentional historical inaccuracies of Baz Luhrman's Moulin Rouge!.~1
862~2591~ For what problems it does have it is a genuinely different take on this kind of material with a firm focus on action, character and humor. No one else should ever attempt to make a superhero movie quite like this, but for The Green Hornet it works.~1
863~2597~[I]t's a bit ironic that in hindsight The Night Clerk will be remembered, if at all, as a movie de Armas was way too good for-an unfortunate mile marker on her road to movie stardom.~0
864~2598~"[VIDEO ESSAY] The best thing the movie does is that it reminds us that we too will wither and die - some sooner than later. Eat some pizza. Smoke a bowl. Any of those experiences will far surpass the one you will have watching ""Inherent Vice."~0
865~2604~Even though we know it could have been so much better, this movie feels like an example of 'guts in genre films'. [Full review in Spanish].~1
866~2605~This movie has all the wit of the original Warner Brothers Cartoons, and a few updated jabs at modern society.~1
867~2607~This is not the smoothest trip: the transitions are bumpy, the lip-synching's imperfect...But rough edges are more than offset by contagious vitality...It may not be precision-tooled, but it's triumphantly alive.~1
868~2608~ Playing a character who can't quite let go of past romantic disappointment despite her apparent present day happiness, Zhou credibly grounds a scenario so lightweight that it often seems about to float away.~1
869~2609~ Carnahan's script is thoughtful, but its ideal venue may be a college debate class, not your local multiplex.~0
870~2612~ Colombiana is caught somewhere in the middle of an engaging character drama and a brainless action extravaganza.~0
871~2613~Sword of Trust is funny. Laugh out loud so.~1
872~2614~By no means a perfect film... but it's a big swing and even though it doesn't always connect, I admire when a filmmaker tries for one.~1
873~2617~While this low-budget Canadian thriller starts as a mildly suspenseful diversion, it turns ridiculous in the final act.~0
874~2620~High production value and diverse tales of terror make this a standout horror anthology.~1
875~2621~ Give Age Of Extinction this much credit: Of all the Transformers movies, this is the longest.~0
876~2622~In trying to one-up the first film, Uncaged becomes more cartoonish and unrealistic (granted, not in the league of The Meg), but that also makes it more fun than the downer original.~1
877~2625~Takes the 'everything-but-the-kitchen-sink' approach. Leaves no sports cliche unturned and no chance for inspirational feel-good moments unvisited.~0
878~2628~A perfect showcase for Justin Long.~1
879~2635~Not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination, but certainly one that offers enough eye-candy and cheap thrills to entertain...~1
880~2640~ While it lives up to the very definition of 'hit and miss', the parts that hit are very funny.~1
881~2649~The movie may not bring anything earthshaking to the zombie sub-genre, but as an exercise in intestine-munching horror, it's largely successful.~1
882~2660~ Returns Loach to the heights of Riff-Raff and Raining Stones, winning stories of working-class life whose politics were integrated rather than smeared on top.~1
883~2664~The sense of authenticity that marks The Light Between Oceans at its best has everything to do with the acting - and if all Cianfrance ever gives us is that, it's worth the price of his lagging third act.~1
884~2665~ Based on the Ray Bradbury short story of the same name, this is a colassal disapopintment - unworthy of the memorable source material.~0
885~2666~Judging by what writer Joel Soisson has come up with here, the franchise is already dead in the water.~0
886~2669~ There are some clever and nicely conceived sequences, and some bursts of wit - though given the writing firepower involved, there should really have been more wit.~1
887~2674~"For those who have never been high, the new film ""Inherent Vice"" will give you a pretty good sense of it. You'll have no idea what's going on. You'll wonder whether you're supposed to know. In the end, though, you won't be sure you care."~0
888~2675~In 'Premature', Green weaves the city, the summer atmosphere, and the urgency of young love into a story that will remind you of your first love.~1
889~2676~ Much of the time, watching Beyond the Black Rainbow is accompanied by head scratching, but perhaps that's the point of this trippy outing.~0
890~2680~A balanced, insightful portrait of the provocative hip-hop icon.~1
891~2684~It's fun to watch the clever, dryly comic, quintessential can man's con.~1
892~2690~ I miss the the world we lived in before I saw Winchester.~0
893~2691~The Boat isn't for everyone. It doesn't have any huge reveals, or ghastly spectral encounters. It's Christine without George Thorogood, The Shining if the only thing haunting Jack Torrance was the endless snow.~1
894~2692~ A movie that's meant to fill this summer's smart-low-budget-thriller slot. Except it's not very smart and it's not very thrilling.~0
895~2693~Tortuous, tormented, and trashy.~0
896~2695~Pitt's best work since A River Runs Through It.~1
897~2701~Riveting thriller with less violence than most; sex, nudity.~0
898~2704~McGregor stages good and bad scenes, but almost all are mannered, lacking the brawling confidence of Roth's prose.~0
899~2707~It's one of those movies that will reveal more and more to youngsters as they rewatch it in years to come... and that's the best kind of film.~1
900~2710~ A showcase for Matt Damon's talents, but a dramatically confused film.~1
901~2713~Above all else, the film is surprising and appealing at every level, and if you think this is a story you wouldn't care about in a million years, then it's especially built for you.~1
902~2721~Intriguing, well-structured and mildly engaging with strong performances, but its balance of comedy, melodrama and romance feels slightly uneven and contrived.~1
903~2728~ An essentially hollow contrivance, more concerned with pushing hot buttons and sparking discussion than organically developing characters or probing complex issues.~0
904~2729~ Enough with the feminism-as-male-titillation, please.~0
905~2731~ [Cursed with] the common horror movie problem of being unintentionally hilarious.~0
906~2732~ I don't like Michael Moore. He cheats. When a film is presented as a documentary we expect some kind of journalistic search for truth ... But questions he raises about guns and violence ...add an immediacy to questions he asks that we all need to answer.~1
907~2734~A second helping would be hard to justify were it not for Depp, whose manic idea of comedy seems right for a Stephen King thriller.~1
908~2735~ Unfortunately, with the big reveal having already arrived in the first act, the film isn't much more than an elongated debate that leaves you thinking: so what?~0
909~2736~...is competent enough to embrace its thrill-seeking mediocrity to the point of stimulating, corrosive curiosity. Trespassers is inspired by its high-wire handy-work of invasion horror~0
910~2739~ ..an uneven job...that is intermittently shocking and dull.~0
911~2741~The Libertine's libidinous charm makes most of its faults instantly forgivable.~1
912~2747~ McLoughlan's unobtrusive style shows but never tells, leaving the viewer to decide if Uisdean deserves forgiveness.~1
913~2749~A big, loud, snarky, garish, testosterone-saturated, nearly incoherent cartoon...[but] that might be enough to satisfy a lot of viewers.~0
914~2751~The best way to combat a lackluster script is good casting, and Diane Lane, John Cusack and Christopher Plummer are quite the foot soldiers in Must Love Dogs.~0
915~2763~ Meet the Robinson tasted like chicken - Chicken Little, that is.~1
916~2765~" Call this go-round ""Friday the Umpteenth"" and be done with it."~0
917~2767~Deals with themes of free will, propaganda, conformity, friendship, aging and responsibility, in a funny and well-crafted package.~1
918~2772~ works superbly in its isolated setpieces, even as the film as a whole doesn't quite hang together~1
919~2773~Gritty, intense and atmospheric, but also shallow, pedestrian and monotonous. It's a dull, forgettable B-movie.~0
920~2774~David O. Russell enters Marty Scorsese territory with the sagacious wit of Mark Twain and satire and slapstick worthy of Preston Sturges~1
921~2775~An addictive film. [Full Review in Spanish]~1
922~2777~"A kind of cross between Richard Linklater's Boyhood and Wild Kingdom, Mia and the White Lion offers a unique spin on the coming-of-age tale with stunning visuals if questionable ethics of ""employing"" real lions to ""act."""~1
923~2778~Whatever Shaft is saying about race, authority, age, gender or masculinity - which are interesting talking points no matter how badly fumbled they are - I keep going back to the rancid humour.~0
924~2780~Jia Zhangke creates atmospheres and images of great poetic breath that are full of suggestive power and meaning. [Full Review in Spanish]~1
925~2782~ The satirical message is that the moral defenders of impressionable American youth would literally rather see violent death than obscenity, but Parker and Stone end up delivering both in overabundant quantities to prove their point.~0
926~2784~Interesting, intriguing and different, Destroyer has mystery, action and incredible acting.~0
927~2790~A masterly tale of the good, the deranged and the doomed that inflects the raw violence of the west with a wry acknowledgement of the demise of codes of honour, this is frighteningly intelligent and imaginative.~1
928~2796~The movie is slick pulp, cheaply funny, surely offensive to anyone squeamish or snake-fearing.~1
929~2799~ This listless biopic of the famed 1950s model is as timid and tame as her photos seem today.~0
930~2800~ It's not a perfect movie, but this hard-edged film ends up being fully engaging thanks to another powerful performance from McConaughey.~1
931~2801~ Neither a horror movie nor a ghost story, it's just a lot of atmosphere and earnest acting looking in vain for a story.~0
932~2803~It makes you feel not only the joy people experienced in the wash of Greene's raucous, truth-saying humor, but also his wisdom and calm.~1
933~2805~If you need a way to laugh at all the reasons you're deficient, or to examine why your white Australian friends are the hot messes they are, grab your sluggers, lather up that body in oil, spark up a dart and laugh. And, hopefully, don't cry.~1
934~2808~ Featuring a charismatic leading man and interesting premise, Limitless is a viscerally appealing sci-fi thriller yet fails to tap into its vast potential. ~0
935~2814~"There are a great many moments and sequences scattered across ""It Chapter Two."" On the other hand, audiences might take issue with there being so many."~1
936~2819~ Mug treads a fine balance between freewheeling comic exuberance and the urge to comment on the state of Poland.~1
937~2822~ A well-paced horror whose slick, exhilarating action sequences are a significant improvement over the original.~1
938~2824~This sequel strays far from the path. [Full Review in Spanish]~1
939~2827~There's no doubt that the notable cast will attract limited audiences in search of a light-hearted diversion, but anyone craving a substantial story about coming-of-age and young love will be bitterly disappointed in this uninspired, vapid mess.~1
940~2828~As I, Robot details how Smith must fight for his survival against an army of white men whom he alone knows are evil, the film might have been called 'I, Hollywood'.~0
941~2829~...a shot of adrenaline in a landscape filled with cinematic clones.~1
942~2830~Easter Parade may not strike the perfect balance between song-dance interludes and story, but it's an appealing show just the same.~1
943~2842~" I try to avoid using the phrase ""with the best will in the world"", but, with the best will in the world, it's hard to escape the notion that Rampage is barely a third as much fun as it ought to be. "~0
944~2844~Serenity is a film that seems to reject understanding or even reality.~1
945~2850~Gory enough to satisfy jaded horror fans and scary enough to offer a decent, frightening night at the movies for everyone else.~1
946~2852~ The film has a lot going for it - a gem of a premise and one of the most outrageous laughs tucked into a movie this year - but it ultimately comes up short.~1
947~2853~ This film won't be troubling awards season. Unless they're handing out Oscars for leading eyebrows.~0
948~2856~It doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but Peter Strickland's hallucinatory horror-comedy looks and sounds like no other genre film in recent memory.~1
949~2859~Resembles a Star Trek episode by way of Scooby-Doo.~0
950~2860~Huston has conjured up a tough but rewarding story of real-life pain and hard-won healing.~1
951~2864~Its portrayal of Britt-Marie sometimes feels condescending, several of its plot turns make no sense, and its visuals add nothing that wasn't already there in the original book.~0
952~2866~Mensore does his due diligence in showing us the claustrophobic, perilous conditions of the mine, even before disaster strikes...~1
953~2868~In a word, Letters to Juliet is rubbish, but Seyfried and Redgrave make it tolerable in their different ways.~0
954~2869~Bullock and Grant are perfectly paired in Two Weeks Notice. The script allows the two actors to be at their comedic best, even though the film as a whole is amateurish in many ways.~1
955~2871~ The movie isn't very different from that Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots game: easy to sell in TV ads and soon stash away in the closet.~0
956~2872~ Cera may be trapped in his unchanging persona, but no more than this picture is walled in by its sitcom conventions.~0
957~2874~Fortunately, Saddam Hussein was unable to access Charlize's make-up people.~1
958~2876~Back to the Future meets Rebel Without a Cause.~1
959~2878~Virtually everything in the movie is off-pitch.~0

965~2903~The 'Final Destination' franchise is the Ramones discography of horror cinema: There's not a lot of variety, but if you liked the first release, there's no reason not to like the rest.~1
966~2904~...a cocky and contrived contraption which gingerly dances around its Medieval-themed mediocrity...[an] overwrought costume drama~0
967~2910~ You thought, 'Wow! Another cool, Jack Sparrow-type makeup job-check out the dead crow on his head!' All one can say of 'The Lone Ranger': what a waste of an excellent costume.~0
968~2911~ Though Perry and Hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed, haphazard script by Jay Scherick and David Ronn, neither the actors nor director Reginald Hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining.~0
969~2913~ This is an intelligent, efficient 70's style thriller that weaves an inspired narrative fabric.~1
970~2915~The trials and tribulations of war have never looked so piercing and atmospheric... this new release of an old favourite is simply a must-have.~1
971~2918~It's hard to get in the film more of a sense than merely skimming the surface.~0
972~2919~... steers a potentially provocative idea in predictable directions, which tends to diminish the emotional impact.~0
973~2920~A serviceable bit of relationship fluff buoyed by a couple of well-tuned performances from Aniston and Vaughn.~1
974~2921~A great deal of the credit for the film's success goes to the wonderful Pernilla August as Britt-Marie, as unusual a protagonist as she is welcome.~1
975~2924~[A] loud and assaultive but fundamentally boring spectacle.~0
976~2928~Memoirs of a Geisha builds a beautiful garden, then runs an interstate through it to let more people in.~0
977~2931~ One of the most sensitive and subtle explorations of sexuality to hit the big screen in the States in a long time.~1
978~2932~There's nothing new with this buddy cop comedy with its cheap, lowbrow humor.~0
979~2933~"Patience Required to Appreciate Anderson's ""Vice."~0
980~2936~Whenever it stays with Piccoli ... it's mysterious and moving, struck by the humility of a man who's not up to playing God.~1
981~2939~ Can stoners alone propel Pineapple to box office success? After all, a couple movie tickets is a few less ounces of that sticky icky.~0
982~2940~The lead actresses are both solid but the direction by Trevor Nunn is dull.~0
983~2942~ a lively and lightweight adventure that finds the elusive middle ground between comedy and comic-book heroics that the makers of 'Fantastic Four' never did.~1
984~2944~ A hearty genre pic fraught with tense social/sexual anxieties.~1
985~2949~Both story and style reveal the calculations of an artist so desperate to get noticed that he forgot to cover his id.~0
986~2951~ [A]s a concise reduction of history, the movie does get at some truth. As an involving piece of storytelling, though, it's lacking.~0
987~2954~Playing an uplifting song at the end of a film doesn't resolve the absence of thematic meaning that was lacking throughout the entire movie.~1
988~2955~Hawke pieces together an impressive and thought-provoking tribute with a Texas-sized heart and the kind of performances that awards are made for. Even when you know what's coming, Blaze haunts you like a classic country song.~1
989~2962~As the head of this diamondback-rattlesnake-of-a-film, Matthew McConaughey strikes within a sadistic realm very few actors would dare to tread. ~1
990~2964~ Stick It is shrill, unrepentantly lame and will surely disappoint any fan of gymnastics as Bendinger substitutes some kind of Olympic-sized political statement in place of a big, rousing finale.~0
991~2969~ Grappling with Churchill's inner humanity and steely resolve, Oldman has offered a portrayal for the ages.~1
992~2974~It's surprising that Lena Waithe's writing is the most disappointing aspect of the film. While Kaluuya and Turner-Smith are impressive, their characters - Queen especially - remain hugely underdeveloped.~0
993~2976~ With superhero films as hot in 2008 as psychedelics were in the 1960s, the new blockbuster superhero film Hancock fits with the label but without any of the ancestry. The 1983 film The Return of Captain Invincible is flipping in its grave.~0
994~2977~One things for certain, while Tone-Deaf isn't the phantasmagorical head trip the marketing suggests, it definitely bends the rules of reality just enough to feel like you've gone on a journey.~1
995~2980~ Lacking the suspense and grip of flicks like The Thing or even minimalist stranded-in-space cinema like Moon, Last Days is saved from total tedium only by competent first-time director Ruairi Robinson and its stellar cast.~0
