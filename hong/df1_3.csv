1344,If the Dancer Dances,Revealing dissection of the demanding art of dancer/choreographer Merce Cunningham via a New York company's re-staging of one of his most famous pieces.,fresh
1345,If the Dancer Dances,"It's less of an insightful backstage documentary than a gushing, sycophantic love letter to the late Merce Cunningham.",rotten
1346,Crown Vic,"My problem with this movie... is that it wants us to empathize with Thomas Jane's character. But the thing is, his character's just a crooked cop.",rotten
1347,Crown Vic,"A police thriller with few police and fewer thrills, Crown Vic nevertheless offers a few rewards for the patient viewer, though these come wrapped in a derivative package.",rotten
1348,Crown Vic,"Crown Vic has strong performances and some topical observations of modern day police work, but it never goes anywhere interesting enough with them.",rotten
1349,Crown Vic,A good film that unfortunately doesn't stand out from the crop. The performances by Thomas Jane and Luke Kleintank are solid and there are a few moments of real inspiration.,fresh
1350,Crown Vic,The four-wheeled title character is more intriguing than its human counterparts in this gimmicky thriller.,rotten
1351,Crown Vic,"Crown Vic offers no ... sweeping sentiments, because it's too busy picking apart the mucky, gray morality of two men...",fresh
1352,Crown Vic,"""Crown Vic"" doesn't sustain a level of suspense and grim analysis throughout the entire endeavor, keeping the picture uneven, but still connecting with undeniable moments of clarity.",fresh
1353,Crown Vic,Not a bad picture. It's just too unexceptional to stand out.,rotten
1354,Crown Vic,"Overall, it's a very nicely made film, but its familiarity is likely to limit its audience potential and mean that [Joel] Souza's talent won't get the recognition it deserves.",fresh
1355,Crown Vic,"The result isn't perfect, but there's enough to peek inside this complex argument surrounding the police with nuanced emotion.",fresh
1356,Crown Vic,"Crown Vic proves to be a limited yet effective study of urban police work initiated by veterans who have gotten this far on street smarts and broken windows policing, rather than the new school of a community policing approach.",fresh
1357,Crown Vic,[Thomas] Jane is the glue and mortar.,fresh
1358,Cubby,...this is not to say that Cubby is a bad film. It is quite a frothy mix of childish innocence and magical realism. It's just nothing of major consequence.,fresh
1359,Cubby,"Cubby is still vaguely enjoyable and endearingly weird, but it's still grades away from testing out of ordinariness.",rotten
1360,Cubby,I personally enjoyed [Cubby] and the off-center oddity of NYC as filtered through an overly imaginative manchild with a penchant for Klonopin and psychedelic cupcakes.,fresh
1361,Cubby,"Despite being framed with a charming style, it unfortunately fails to draw out compelling connections amongst its characters.",rotten
1362,Cubby,Very brave to portray yourself as being unable to connect with anyone your age. Most people put the coolest version of themself up onscreen if they are going to do so.,fresh
1363,Cubby,"The character of Mark Nabel wouldn't seem out of a place in a Will Ferrell slacker comedy, or one of Tim Robinson's more outlandish sketches - a familiar comic character, but one that feels thrillingly alien within a film aimed at queer audiences.",fresh
1364,Cubby,"By allowing the writing and direction to remain sympathetic to Mark, the film actually finds some important things to say about protective childhoods and the way we choose to treat people who are different from ourselves.",fresh
1365,Cubby,"[Mark] Blane tells the story of a man whose life is a mess without turning his film into a mess in the process, and that's trickier than it looks.",fresh
1366,Antrum: The Deadliest Film Ever Made,"Antrum is pure folk horror eeriness, right down to the brilliantly off kilter score, and has the potential to be a major cult hit, given its ingenious hook.",fresh
1367,Antrum: The Deadliest Film Ever Made,Isn't amateurish enough to be charming or professional enough to pull off the con job.,rotten
1368,Antrum: The Deadliest Film Ever Made,"It may not convince viewers that the film is cursed and they're going to die after watching it, but its commitment to the gimmick, its ethereal score, and its eerie imagery make for a creepy and effective throwback horror film.",fresh
1369,Antrum: The Deadliest Film Ever Made,"Anyone who has a fondness for seventies grindhouse or even arthouse obscurities will find something to enjoy here, such is the attention to detail. Everything about the film-within-a-film appears authentic",fresh
1370,Antrum: The Deadliest Film Ever Made,"the po-faced documentary sections which frame this film-within-a-film also serve to muddy its waters further, making us question precisely what we may be sacrificing of ourselves when we willingly suspend disbelief and yield to art's illusory sway.",fresh
1371,Antrum: The Deadliest Film Ever Made,"Tense and unnerving, unpredictable and mean spirited, Antrum... adds layers to the terrifying power of cinema.",fresh
1372,Drive,"Drive 2019 proves Tarun Mansukhani to be unfit for even a provisional licence to direct, presenting a watered-down, technically deficient bore that may as well have been renamed Drivel.",rotten
1373,Drive,"Trite action movie has mild language, product placement.",rotten
1374,Drive,"Whether Drive is so bad it's good, so unwatchable that it's watchable, a crack-a-box-of-wine-and-invite-your-friends-over-for-a-hate-watch is debatable.",rotten
1375,Drive,"Sushant Singh Rajput and Jacqueline Fernandez star in a cheap imitation of Fast &amp; Furious, which has to be one of Netflix India's worst mistakes ever.",rotten
1376,Drive,Gaping gaps in the plotline recede into the background in the face of ordinary car chases that routinely look plastic and an embarrassingly low-brow extended climax that feels like the work of an entry-level animation student.,rotten
1377,Drive,"Subtlety is not the film's forte. Neither is clarity, characterization, coherence or anything else that any reasonable person requires.",rotten
1378,Drive,"No scene or subplot in Drive has any reason to exist, but still, it continues to labour on.",rotten
1379,Klaus,Klaus is the surprise of this awards season. [Full review in Spanish],fresh
1380,Klaus,"Beyond the approachable storytelling, fun cast, and revisionist mythology, however, lies the stunning craftsmanship of the animation itself.",fresh
1381,Klaus,"Instead, it's a clever, not-too-sentimental Hatfields v McCoys take on the legend of Santa Claus.",fresh
1382,Klaus,"An engaging revisionist tale, destined to become another Christmas classic.",fresh
1383,Klaus,"While Klaus has a number of the same faults you'll find in a number of run-of-the-mill animated family movies . . . , more animated works could stand to take a cue from its visual creativity.",fresh
1384,Klaus,"A cut above the average seasonal tale due to its impressive cast and visual inventiveness, this film is full of unexpected references which will entertain older viewers but don't get in the way of the plot.",fresh
1385,Klaus,"The fluidity, the smoothness of the 3D animation...people, it looks good, incredible.",fresh
1386,Klaus,This should be eligible for Best Animated Picture.,fresh
1387,Klaus,"Destined to be added to the yearly holiday viewing rotation, Klaus is worth writing to Santa about.",fresh
1388,Klaus,"The animation is beautiful, the story is beautiful, the music is beautiful.",fresh
1389,Klaus,"Sure you know where the story is going, but the journey is delightful nonetheless.",fresh
1390,Klaus,"Essentially a heartwarming tale of a millennial entrepreneur disrupting the status quo through social enterprise, Klaus is a pure pleasure to watch.",fresh
1391,Earthquake Bird,It's difficult to connect with any of the characters and feel any sympathy for them.,rotten
1392,Earthquake Bird,Earthquake Bird is definitely a cut above Netflix's usual fare. On a surface level the film doesn't have that weird plastic sheen Netflix releases always seem to be cheapened by.,fresh
1393,Earthquake Bird,Earthquake Bird meanders through its plot points in a narrative that feels lost in translation.,rotten
1394,Earthquake Bird,"It's as if they built a portrait of a fascinating female killer and then chickened out, settling into the Lifetime ""men are terrifying"" model instead of exploring something more dynamic.",rotten
1395,Earthquake Bird,"An underwhelming, melodramatic story that culminates in a shaky ending dooms Earthquake Bird.",rotten
1396,Earthquake Bird,"Earthquake Bird is ultimately more of a puzzle than a thrill, leaving viewers to wonder what happened to Lily and what led to her disappearance.",rotten
1397,Earthquake Bird,A mousy Alicia Vikander casts a convincing spell...and Westmoreland finds plenty of additional intrigue in this late 1980s Japanese setting...,fresh
1398,Earthquake Bird,"Earthquake Bird is somewhat laborious in making its points, but it's a film whose unsettling qualities will grow on you with time.",fresh
1399,Earthquake Bird,"It's unfortunate that Earthquake Bird falls apart in the way that it does, as a film with this much of a unique premise and setting and populated with talented actors had such potential.",rotten
1400,Earthquake Bird,"There's a choppiness and impatience to the storytelling, with crucial scenes getting dispatched in a cursory fashion.",rotten
1401,Earthquake Bird,"Absorbing but slow tale has nudity, language, violence.",fresh
1402,Earthquake Bird,"If the frames are converted into data for a seismograph to read, be ready to see mainly flat lines.",fresh
1403,Red Letter Day,The familial dynamic... is so strong that many of the story's obvious faults can be forgiven just by virtue of the fact we enjoy watching these people fight for their lives.,fresh
1404,Red Letter Day,"Even in its runtime, the movie disappoints by the sheer laziness of never pushing the screenplay to a possibly climactic finale. Instead, we get weak family non-drama and a series of uninteresting horror moments relying way more on blood than guts.",rotten
1405,Red Letter Day,"Red Letter Day has an idea, but neither the means to execute nor the vision to deliver a tooth-and-nail struggle against societal breakdowns.",rotten
1406,Red Letter Day,"Despite its initial slow start, Red Letter Day turns into a satisfying horror comedy that cleverly makes a sleepy little neighbourhood wake up and as the violence, horror and the black comedy laughs ensue...",fresh
1407,Red Letter Day,"In many ways Red Letter Day is a humour heavy, daylight spin on The Purge, one which works well, but could benefit from a longer run time.",fresh
1408,Red Letter Day,"Taking its cue from The Purge (2013) and Assassination Nation (2018), this grimly allegorises a country all too easily polarised against itself, street by bloody street. For once those letters have arrived, everyone goes postal.",fresh
1409,Philophobia: Or the Fear of Falling in Love,"Despite all the missteps, Cole and Burt are onto something here. The film is sprinkled with some surprisingly deep psychological insight and neon-noir-ish colors...",fresh
1410,Philophobia: Or the Fear of Falling in Love,"With a sumptuous color palette, Philophobia will leave viewers viscerally intoxicated despite the purposeful mental scarring.",fresh
1411,Philophobia: Or the Fear of Falling in Love,"This film could be the ultimate film to watch for those with a fear of commitment, you'll either understand where the main character is coming from, or will feel so uncomfortable that you'll be running for the door.",fresh
1412,Philophobia: Or the Fear of Falling in Love,"...Philophobia is a strange mix of comedy and horror that's, unfortunately, only intermittently effective.",fresh
1413,Philophobia: Or the Fear of Falling in Love,"The dating scene in Los Angeles can be hellish, but Philophobia: or the Fear of Falling in Love takes kicks it up a notch. A stylish and intriguing debut, the film is a worthy watch as this holiday season takes off.",fresh
1414,Philophobia: Or the Fear of Falling in Love,Tyler Cole's debut feature is unlike any breakup movie before it.,fresh
1415,Philophobia: Or the Fear of Falling in Love,"What's more amusing... is how you can almost predict its ending right from the start, but you are still kept engaged and curious to see how it is going to reach that climax. It manages to stay adequately entertaining and pleasurable to sit through.",fresh
1416,Philophobia: Or the Fear of Falling in Love,"Philophobia may mean 'fear of love,' but this is clearly a labor of it.",fresh
1417,Philophobia: Or the Fear of Falling in Love,"The aesthetic choices and percussive pervasiveness in the score help represent Damien, the man, the podcaster and philophobic. This project is clearly a labour of love and I'm looking forward to Tyler Cole's next production.",fresh
1418,Philophobia: Or the Fear of Falling in Love,"A sharp, intelligent and original rom-com.",fresh
