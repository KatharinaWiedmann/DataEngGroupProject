2835,Aladdin,An unimaginative remake that can be entertaining but feels empty and forgettable.,rotten
2836,Aladdin,There's enough here to make the film stand out on its own. Whether it stands out for the right reasons is up to the viewer.,fresh
2837,Aladdin,"An unsubtle, fast-moving film with plenty of jokes and a visual style that would suit a themed Las Vegas hotel, it's certainly not an all-time Disney great, but I can see it being a half-term hit.",fresh
2838,Aladdin,The design is gawdy without the joy of camp. The pacing is manic. The editing is bizarre.,rotten
2839,Aladdin,You can never unsee dance sequences directed by Guy Ritchie.,rotten
2840,Aladdin,My wish is that this would have been a better movie. The Disney whimsy and magic is lacking in Aladdin.,rotten
2841,Aladdin,"Thankfully, Aladdin is not a shot-for-shot remake, which gives Ritchie room to provide his own unique take. In turn, he incorporates little touches amid clever chase scenes and entertaining dialogue to lift the film.",fresh
2842,Aladdin,"The film is breathless, while never taking a breath, and when everything is big, brassy, and bold, even a manic genie has trouble standing out.",rotten
2843,Aladdin,"""Aladdin"" delivers the goods, especially when the music is playing, and while it may not be exactly what you wished for, it's close enough.",fresh
2844,Aladdin,"None of the filmmaking or acting really conveys that wonder of discovery; of falling in love. It's a facsimile of that feeling; a not-so-cheap copy. And, weirdly enough, it inspired in me only a small sense of loneliness.",rotten
2845,Shaft,"Whatever Shaft is saying about race, authority, age, gender or masculinity - which are interesting talking points no matter how badly fumbled they are - I keep going back to the rancid humour.",rotten
2846,Shaft,"There's not much else to this routine and sometimes retrograde actioner. Jackson deserves better material, but even so it's impressive how far he can carry it.",rotten
2847,Shaft,"This is a very strange movie... They've taken one of the coolest, suavest characters in movie history and cast him in this multigenerational ""grumpy old dad"" sitcom.",rotten
2848,Shaft,"Add this to the pile of crap legacy sequels like ""A Good Day to Die Hard,"" and ""Blues Brothers 2000.""",rotten
2849,Shaft,"Not having a stronger, more serious plot means the film will likely appeal more to Shaft newbies than to Shaft devotees.",rotten
2850,Shaft,"It's a new way to approach an old character and it tries harder to give its main characters something to do than a lot of its colleagues do, and there is something worthy in that.",fresh
2851,Shaft,If you are of a younger generation you will relate to many of the pop culture references that Shaft (2019) provides.,fresh
2852,Shaft,"Although a bit out of place for its time, the fifth Shaft film packs enough gunfights, wisecracks, and thrills to make it a decent entry in the series. Samuel L. Jackson fans will not be disappointed, and neither will fans of Richard Roundtree.",fresh
2853,Shaft,"For those of us weaned on 1970s and '80s television, Shaft feels like dozing off on a shag rug - an unconscious nod into a long, open loop of nostalgia that conjures an entire, and unique, set of sounds and textures.",fresh
2854,Shaft,The messages are bad and the movie is bad. It's plain and clear why the studio dumped this on Netflix internationally.,rotten
2855,Shaft,"The proceedings are still intermittently fun, especially because of Jackson who is clearly in his element here.",fresh

2859,Being Frank,Director Miranda Bailey put together an overall enjoyable film reminiscent of the sleeper films of an era of filmmaking that is altogether lost,fresh
2860,Being Frank,Inconsistent lurches between romp comedy and soap opera melodrama detract as the plot noose tightens and the truth closes in on Frank.,rotten
2861,Being Frank,"...a tonally inconsistent, unsatisfying film that is neither funny nor insightful...",rotten
2862,Being Frank,"Jim Gaffigan mugs as a dad with two families. A few interesting pieces, but it's basically a TV sitcom version of a British slamming doors farce.",rotten
2863,Being Frank,"No faulting a game cast, but even talented actors can't make this creaky and marginally creepy farce hit enough of the right notes.",rotten
2864,Being Frank,Bailey's film ultimately feels like a misguided attempt to complicate male entitlement by humanizing it.,rotten
2865,Being Frank,A frantic and desperate attempt to extract some laughs from a misguided premise.,rotten

2872,Blue Note Records: Beyond the Notes,"The label is generally considered unparalleled in its impact on music, singular catalogue, and the artistic freedom it afforded its musicians. Or should I say affords, since the film makes abundantly clear that Blue Note is very much alive and well.",fresh
2873,Blue Note Records: Beyond the Notes,"When the landscape of documentary films is embodied by a spectrum of truly groundbreaking work, Blue Note Records: Beyond the Notes just feels a bit lackluster.",rotten
2874,Blue Note Records: Beyond the Notes,I am grateful to Sophie Huber for opening my eyes-and ears. She has made a memorable film that jazz buffs shouldn't miss.,fresh
2875,Blue Note Records: Beyond the Notes,Great interviews; great music; great Black history. Enough said.,fresh
2876,Blue Note Records: Beyond the Notes,The documentary proves that the history and mythology of American jazz is as intoxicating as the music itself.,fresh

2881,Gags the Clown,"GAGS THE CLOWN is no sideshow pushover. It's like MOCKINGBIRD meets SLENDER MAN but way, way better.",fresh
2882,Gags the Clown,The found-footage approach utilized here doesn't really bring anything of value to the proceedings. The combination of humor and horror never quite pans out either.,rotten
2883,Gags the Clown,"Another poorly executed, found-footage movie that adds to an already-overflowing pile of forgettable titles just like it.",rotten
2884,Gags the Clown,"It all adds up to an offbeat, unusual horror film that totally has its own identity.",fresh
2885,Gags the Clown,"As someone who is always up for more clown-based horror hijinks, Gags feels like something of a letdown; there is a genuinely good idea at its core, but his approach never really works for me as a viewer.",rotten
2886,The Dead Don't Die,"Maybe the point is to highlight the way we are all sleepwalking into disaster with next-to-no resistance, but the film doesn't seem complex enough to offer it that much credit.",rotten
2887,The Dead Don't Die,"It's tough to distinguish a movie trying to wring humor from a deliberately enervated take on a typically breathless subgenre, from one that's just dull and ineffective.",rotten
2888,The Dead Don't Die,"The fact that Jarmusch is saying we're all zombies and not in a subtle way just makes the film more enjoyable, acknowledging that we all have our own likes, or addictions.",fresh
2889,The Dead Don't Die,"Why did Jarmusch pick a zombie film? That's possibly a question that will pop up on most viewers' minds, especially Jarmusch devotees, and for the first two thirds of the film it does seem like the director wants to have a bit fun with the genre.",rotten
2890,The Dead Don't Die,"Jim Jarmusch's B-movie satire rises slowly, brings our attention to its stench, and proceeds to wander aimlessly, disappointingly caught in its own daze.",rotten
2891,The Dead Don't Die,Jarmusch has put out a very different horror movie for the year (and for him). The Dead Don't Die is a fun time in the cinema and actually has more to say than you might think.,fresh

2893,The Dead Don't Die,The Dead Don't Die has all the components of a cult classic but was not executed properly. It's all over the place &amp; not even a stellar performance by Adam Driver can save it.,rotten
2894,The Dead Don't Die,"The commentary is valuable and timely, but the narrative and formal vehicle -- even with its wonderful moments -- is not that solid. [Full Review in Spanish]",fresh
2895,The Dead Don't Die,The problem is that integrating so many characters ends up turning the plot into a real disaster. [Full review in Spanish],rotten
2896,The Dead Don't Die,"Uniting all the Jarmusch output are achingly cool casts, indescribably eclectic and wonderful soundtracks - and a joyous disregard for the expectations of anyone who walks into one of his films expecting it to obey the rules of the alleged genre.",fresh
2897,The Dead Don't Die,[I]ts slow and safe tone makes it one of the dullest entries in the genre so far. You will probably like it if you read the New Yorker.,rotten
